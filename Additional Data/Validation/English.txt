ace 
in the organization of the novel. The state, which in the 
pattern of the book, is the organ of oppression of the poor and 
therefore of Oliver, now becomes the servant of Oliver. The 
oppressed are now divided (through the working of the plot) 
into the good and deserving poor who help Oliver win his 
rights and the bad and criminal poor who help Monks and 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 133 

must be eliminated. It is a conception which makes a mockery 
of the opening chapters of the book, where poverty has been 
revealed to us in a light which makes the facile terms of good 
and bad irrelevant. 

By the end of the book Nancy can be pigeon-holed as 
good, Sikes as bad. But who can say whether the starving 
creatures of the opening chapters are good or bad? It is for 
this kind of reason that the plot of Oliver Twist has so disastrous 
an effect on the novel. Not merely is it silly and mechanical and 
troublesome, but it expresses an interpretation of life infinitely 
lss profound and honest than the novel itself reveals. 

The disaster, happily, is not complete. For one thing, the 
plot does not immediately, with the entrance of Mr. Brownlow, 
gain entire ascendancy. The kidnapping of Oliver by Nancy 
and Sikes and his return to the thieves gives the novel a 
reprieve. The robbery episode is excellently done. But in this 
section (Chaps. XII to XXIX) the plot is beginning to seep 
into the underworld. Monks appears. And the ^introduction 
of the workhouse (the death of old Sally, the marriage of Mr. 
Bumble), despite some delicious moments ("It's all U.P. here, 
Mrs. Corney"; Noah and Charlotte eating oysters; "Won't 
you tell your own B?"), to6 obviously serves the contrivances 
of the plot. 

Once, however, the robbery is done with and Oliver awakes 
for a second time in the respectable world, the plot com- 
pletely reasserts itself. The third quarter of the book (Chaps. 
XXIX to XXXIX) is its weakest section. Oliver is here entirely 
at the mercy of the Maylies and the plot. Monks bobs up all 
over the place. And our interest is held (if at all) only by the 
Bumble passages, now completely involved in the plot, and the 
incidental 'characters,' Giles and Brittles, Blathers and Duff. 
And because these characters have no part in the underlying 
pattern of the book and are therefore, unlike Bumble and 
Fagin and the Artful Dodger and Noah Claypole, without 
symbolic significance, they are merely eccentrics, comic relief, 
with all the limitations the phrase implies. 

The basic conflict of the novel is brought, in this quarter, 
almost to a standstill; the people who have captured our 
imagination scarcely appear at all. The world of the opening 



134 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

chapters has been replaced by another world in which kindly 
old doctors like Losberne and crusty but amiable eccentrics 
like Grimwig are in control of the situation. But after what we 
have already experienced, we simply cannot believe in this 
world in the way we believed in the other. 

In the final quarter of the book (Chap. XXXIX onwards) 
plot and pattern, artifice and truth, struggle in a last, violent 
encounter. The plot wins the first round by extracting Nancy 
from the clutches of the pattern. The girl's genuine humanity, 
revealed earlier in the novel by the simple moving language 
of her moment of compassion for the suffering wretches within 
the walls of the jail, is debased by the plot into the conven- 
tional cliches of cheap melodrama. But Nancy's abduction is 
countered almost at once by one of the great episodes of the 
novel, the trial of the Artful Dodger. This scene is irrelevant to 
the plot except in so far as the Dodger has to be got out of the 
way before the final dispensing of reward and punishment. It 
is an interesting instance of the power of Dickens's genius 
that he should have realized that in the Dodger he had created 
a figure which the plot was quite incapable either of absorbing or 
obliterating. And so he is obliged to give the irrepressible boy 
his final fling, a fling which again raises the book into serious 
art and plays an essential part in its (by this time) almost 
forgotten pattern. 

The trial of the Artful Dodger (it is a greater because 
emotionally and morally a profounder scene than Jonathan 
Wild's dance without music) re-states in an astonishing form 
the central theme of Oliver Twist: what are the poor to do 
against the oppressive state? The Dodger throughout the book 
is magnificently done: his precosity, the laboured irony of his 
conversation (which becomes involuntarily a comment on the 
quality of Dickens's own irony), his shrewdness, his grotesque 
urbanity, his resourcefulness (gloriously at variance with his 
appearance), his tremendous vitality, all are revealed without 
false pathos but with an effect of great profundity. 

For what is so important about the Artful Dodger is not his 
oddity but his normality, not his inability to cope with the 
world but his very ability to cope with it on its own terms. 
Oliver is afraid of the world, the Dodger defies it; it has made 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 135 

him what he is and he will give back as good as he got. His 
trial contrasts in the novel with all the other trials. He turns 
up with all his guns loaded and fires broadside after broadside 
which for all their fantastic unexpectedness and apparent 
inappropriateness have an irony beyond any other statements 
in the novel. 

"It was indeed Mr. Dawkins, who, shuffling into the office with 
the big coat-sleeves tucked up as usual, his left hand in his pocket, 
and his hat in his right hand, preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait 
altogether indescribable, and, taking his place in the dock, requested 
in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that 'ere disgraceful 
sitivation for. 

'Hold your tongue, will you? ' said the jailer. 

Tin an Englishman, ain't I?' rejoined the Dodger; 'where are 
my priwileges? ' 

'You'll get your privileges soon enough,' retorted the jailer, 
'and pepper with 'em.' 

'We'll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has 
got to say to the beaks, if I don't,' replied Mr. Dawkins. 'Now then! 
Wot is this here business? I shall thank the madg'strates to dispose 
of this here little affair, and not to keep me while they read the paper 
for I've got an appointment with a genelman in the city, and as I'm 
a man of my word and wery punctual in business matters, he'll go 
away if I ain't there to my time, and then pr'aps there won't be an 
action for damage against them as kept me away. Oh, no, certainly 
not!' 

At this point the Dodger, with a show of being very particular 
with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter, desired the jailer 
to communicate 'the names of them two files as was on the bench,' 
which so tickled the spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily 
as Master Bates could have done if he had heard the request. 

'Silence there!' cried the jailer. 

'What is this?' inquired one of the magistrates. 

'A pick-pocketing case, your worship.' 

'Has the boy ever been here before?' 

'He ought to have been, a many times,* replied the jailer. 'He 
has been pretty well everywhere else. I know him well, your 
worship.' 

'Oh! you know me, do you?' cried the Artful, making a note of 
the statement. 'Wery good. That's a case of deformation of character 
anyway.' 

Here there was another laugh, and another cry of silence. 



136 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

'Now then, where are the witnesses? ' said the clerk. 

Ah! that's right/ added the Dodger. 'Where are they? I should 
like to see 'em.' 

This wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped 
forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown 
gentleman in a crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom, 
which, being a very old one, he deliberately put back again, after 
trying it on his own countenance. For this reason, he took the 
Dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him, and the said 
Dodger being searched, had upon his person a silver snuff-box, 
with the owner's name engraved upon the lid. This gentleman had 
been discovered on reference to the Court Guide, and being then 
and there present, swore that the snuff-box was his, and that he had 
missed it on the previous day, the moment he had disengaged himself 
from the crowd before referred to. He had also remarked a young 
gentleman in the throng particularly active in making his way about, 
and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him. 

'Have you anything to ask this witness, boy? ' said the magistrate. 

*I wouldn't abase myself by descending to hold no conversation 
with him/ replied the Dodger. 

'Have you anything to say at all?' 

*Do you hear his worship ask if you have anything to say?' 
inquired the jailer, nudging the silent Dodger with his elbow. 

C I beg your pardon/ said the Dodger, looking up with an air of 
abstraction. 'Did you redress yourself to me, my man?' 

*I never see such an out-and-out young wagabond, your worship/ 
observed the officer with a grin. 'Do you mean to say anything, you 
young shaver?' 

'No/ replied the Dodger, 'not here, for this ain't the shop for 
justice; besides which, my attorney is a-breakfasting this morning 
with the Wice-President of the House of Commons; but I shall have 
something to say elsewhere, and so will he, and so will a wery 
numerous and 'spectable circle of acquaintance as '11 make them 
beaks wish they'd never been born, or that they'd got their footmen 
to hang 'em up to their own hat-pegs afore they let 'em come out 
this morning to try it on upon me. I'll ' 

'There! He's fully committed!' interposed the clerk. 'Take him 
away.' 

'Come on/ said the jailer. 

'Oh, ah! I'll come on/ replied the Dodger, brushing his hat 
with the palm of his hand. 'Ahl (to the Bench), it's no use your 
looking frightened; I won't show you no mercy, not a ha'porth of it. 
You'll pay for this, my fine fellers. I wouldn't be you for something! 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 137 

I wouldn't go free, now, if you was to fall down on your knees and 
ask me. Here, carry me off to prison! Take me away!' " 7 

Now the point about the Dodger's defiance which is apt 
to escape our notice, so fantastic and uproarious is the scene 
and so used are we to regarding a Dickens novel simply in 
terms of a display of eccentric 'character/ is the actual sub- 
stance of his comments. Yet in fact, if we recall the court in 
which Mr. Fang had heard Oliver's case, we must realize the 
justice of the Dodger's complaints, which strike at the very 
heart of the judicial system that is doing its worst on him. 
Where are the Englishman's privileges? Where is the law that 
allows the jailer to say what he does? What, in sober fact, are 
these magistrates? What comment could be more relevant 
than the contemptuous "this ain't the shop for justice"? The 
importance of the Artful Dodger in the pattern of the novel is 
that he, almost alone of the characters of the underworld, does 
stick up for himself, does continue and develop the conflict 
that Oliver had begun when he asked for more. 

The final section of the book (the murder of Nancy, the 
flight and end of Sikes, the death of Fagin and the tying-up of the 
plot) is an extraordinary mixture of the genuine and the bogus. 
The violence which has run right through the novel reaches its 
climax with the murder of Nancy; and the sense of terror is 
remarkably well sustained right up to the death of Sikes. 

Here again Dickens 's instinct for the symbolic background 
is what grips our imagination. The atmosphere of squalid 
London, powerfully present in so much of the novel, is here 
immensely effective, especially the description of Folly Ditch 
and Jacob's Island, sombre and decayed, "crazy wooden 
galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses, with 
holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows 
broken and patched, with poles thrust out on which to dry 
the linen that is never there . . . chimneys half crushed, half 
hesitating to fall. . . ." 8 The scene itself ceases to be a mere 
backcloth and becomes a sculptured mass making an integral 
part of the novel's pattern. So that in the end it is not Sikes' 
conscience that we remember but a black picture of human 
squalor and desolation. Sikes is gathered into the world that 
has begotten him and the image of that world makes us under- 



138 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

stand him and even pity him, not with an easy sentimentality, 
but through a sense of all the hideous forces that have made 
him what he is. 

The end of Fagin is a different matter. It is sensational in 
the worst sense, with a News of the World interest which 
touches nothing adequately and is worse than inadequate 
because it actually coarsens our perceptions. It is conceived 
entirely within the terms of the plot (Oliver is taken in the 
name of morality to the condemned cell to find out where 
the missing papers are hidden) and the whole debasing effect 
of the plot on the novel is immediately illustrated; for it is 
because he is working within the moral framework of the 
plot in which the only standards are those of the sanctity 
of property and complacent respectability that Dickens 
cannot offer us any valuable human insights, cannot give his 
characters freedom to live as human beings. 

That is why the struggle throughout Oliver Twist between 
the plot and the pattern is indeed a life and death struggle, a 
struggle as to whether the novel shall live or not. And in so 
far as the plot succeeds in twisting and negating the pattern 
the value of the novel is in fact weakened. To a considerable 
degree the novel is thus ruined; the loss of tension in the third 
quarter and the dubious close are the testimony. But the total 
effect is not one of disaster. The truth and depth of the central 
vision are such that a vitality is generated which struggles 
against and survives the plot. Oliver himself does not survive; 
but the force he has set in motion does. This force let us 
call it the sense of the doom and aspirations of the oppressed 
is too strong to be satisfied with the dream-solution of Oliver's 
metamorphosis, too enduring to let us forget the fat gentleman in 
the white waistcoat who has so conveniently faded from the 
picturetillheisrecalled by the Artful Dodger. Confused, uneven, 
topsy-turvy as the effect of the novel is we would yet be doing it 
great injustice to discuss it, as it is often discussed, simply in 
terms of random moments and exuberant caricature. There is 
pattern behind that power, art behind the vitality, and if we 
recognize this in Oliver Twist we shall not come unarmed to 
Dickens's later, more mature and greater books: Bleak House, 
Little Dorrit, Great Expectations, Our Mutual Friend. 



V. EMILY BRONTE: 
WUTHERING HEIGHTS (1847) 

Wuthering Heights, like all the greatest works of art, is at once 
concrete and yet general, local and yet universal. Because so 
much nonsense has been written and spoken about the Brontes 
and because Emily in particular has been so often presented 
to us as a ghost-like figure surrounded entirely by endless 
moorland, cut off from anything so banal as human society, 
not of her time but of eternity, it is necessary to emphasize 
at the outset the local quality of the book. 

Wuthering Heights is about England in 1847. The people 
it reveals live not in a never-never land but in Yorkshire. 
Heathcliff was born not in the pages of Byron, but in a Liver- 
pool slum. The language of Nelly, Joseph and Hareton is the 
language of Yorkshire people. The story of Wuthering Heights 
is concerned not with love in the abstract but with the passions 
of living people, with property-ownership, the attraction of 
social comforts, the arrangement of marriages, the importance 
of education, the validity of religion, the relations of rich and 
poor. 

There is nothing vague about this novel; the mists in it 
are the mists of the Yorkshire moors; if we speak of it as 
having an elemental quality it is because the very elements, 
the great forces of nature are evoked, which change so slowly 
that in the span of a human life they seem unchanging. But in 
this evocation there is nothing sloppy or uncontrolled. On the 
contrary the realization is intensely concrete: we seem to smell 
the kitchen of Wuthering Heights, to feel the force of the 
wind across the moors, to sense the very changes of the 
seasons. Such concreteness is achieved not by mistiness but by 
precision. 

It is necessary to stress this point but not, of course, to 

139 



140 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

force it to a false conclusion. The power and wonder of Emily 
Bronte's novel does not lie in naturalistic description, nor in 
a detailed analysis of the hour-by-hour issues of social living. 
Her approach is, quite obviously, not the approach of Jane 
Austen; it is much nearer to the approach of Dickens. Indeed, 
Wuthering Heights is essentially the same kind of novel as 
Oliver Twist. It is not a romance, not (despite the film bearing 
the same title) an escape from life to the wild moors and 
romantic lovers. It is certainly not a picaresque novel and it 
cannot adequately be described as a moral fable, though it 
has a strong, insistent pattern. But the pattern, like that of 
Dickens 's novel, cannot be abstracted as a neat sentence: 'its 
germ is not an intellectualized idea or concept. 

Emily Bronte works not in ideas but in symbols, that is 
to say concepts which have a significance and validity on a 
level different from that of logical thought. Just as the signifi- 
cance of the workhouse in Oliver Twist cannot adequately be 
conceived in merely logical terms but depends on a host of 
associations including its physical shape and colour which 
logical analysis may penetrate but is unlikely adequately to 
convey, so the significance of the moors in Wuthering Heights 
cannot be suggested in the cold words of logic (which does 
not mean that it is illogical). The symbolic novel is an advance 
on the moral fable just in the sense that a symbol can be 
richer can touch on more of life than an abstract moral 
concept. 

The opening sentence of the Social Contract gives a simple 
example: "Man was born free, but everywhere he is in chains." 
Of the two statements in this sentence the first is abstract, the 
second symbolic. And the impact of the second on our imagina- 
tion is greater than that of the first for this very reason. (If one 
were concerned to go deeper into the matter one might suggest 
that Rousseau knew that man was in chains but merely specu- 
lated that he had been born free.) Now, whereas the symbolism 
of the moral fable (and the fable is itself a kind of extended 
symbol) is inherently limited by the abstract concept behind 
it, the symbolism of Wuthering Heights or the good part of 
Oliver Twist is the expression of the very terms in which the 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 141 

novel has been conceived.* In fact, it ts the novel and the 
novel stands or falls by its validity, its total adequacy to life. 

Wuthering Heights is a vision of what life in 1847 was like. 
Whether it can be described as a vision of what life as such 
all life is like is a question we will consider later. It is, for 
all its appearance of casualness and the complexity of its 
family relationships, a very well- constructed book, in which 
the technical problems of presentation have been most care- 
fully thought out. The roles of the two narrators, Lockwood 
and Nelly Dean, are not casual. Their function (they the two 
most 'normal' people in the book) is partly to keep the story 
close to the earth, to make it believable, partly to comment on 
it from a common-sense point of view and thereby to reveal 
in part the inadequacy of such common sense. They act as 
a kind of sieve to the story, sometimes a double sieve, which 
has the purpose not simply of separating off the chaff, but of 
making us aware of the difficulty of passing easy judgments. 
One is left always with the sense that the last word has not 
been said. 

The narrators do not as a rule talk realistically, though 
sometimes Nelly's part is to slip into a Yorkshire dialect that 
'places' what she is describing and counteracts any tendency 
(inherent in symbolic art) to the pretentious. At critical points 
in the narrative we are not conscious of their existence at all; 
there is no attempt at a limiting verisimilitude of speech. 
They do not impose themselves between us and the scene. 
But at other times their attitudes are important. 

One of the subtleties of the book is the way these attitudes 
change and develop; Lockwood and Nelly, like us, learn from 
what they experience, though at first their limitations are made 
use of, as in the very first scene when the expectations of the 
conventional Lockwood are so completely shocked by what 
he finds at Wuthering Heights. He goes there, he the normal 

* A simple, though not infallible, indication of the kind of novel one is 
dealing with is given by the naming of characters. In allegory and the novel 
of 'humours' names always denote character e.g., Faithful and Squire 
Allworthy. In totally non-symbolic novelists like Jane Austen the names are 
quite without significance: Emma Woodhouse might equally well be called 
Anne Elliot. In novels which have a certain symbolic quality the names of 
characters generally have a peculiar nghtness of their own: Heathcliff, 
Noah Claypole, Henry James's characters. 



142 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

Victorian gentleman, expecting to find the normal Victorian 
middle-class family. And what he finds a house seething 
with hatred, conflict, horror is a shock to us, too. The attack on 
our complacency, moral, social and spiritual, has already begun. 

The centre and core of the book is the story of Catherine 
and Heathcliff. It is a story which has four stages. The first 
part, ending in the visit to Thrushcross Grange, tells of the 
establishing of a special relationship between Catherine and 
Heathcliff and of their common rebellion against Hindley and 
his regime in Wuthering Heights. In the second part is revealed 
Catherine's betrayal of Heathcliff, culminating in her death. 
The third part deals with Heathcliff's revenge, and the final 
section, shorter than the others, tells of the change that comes 
over Heathcliff and of his death. Even in the last two sections, 
after her death, the relationship with Catherine remains the 
dominant theme, underlying all else that occurs. 

It is not easy to suggest with any precision the quality of 
feeling that binds Catherine and Heathcliff. It is not primarily 
a sexual relationship. Emily Bronte is not, as is sometimes 
suggested, afraid of sexual love; the scene at Catherine's death 
is proof enough that this is no platonic passion, yet to describe the 
attraction as sexual is surely quite inadequate. Catherine tries 
to express her feelings to Nelly (she is about to marry Linton). 

"My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff's miseries, 
and I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in 
living is himself. If all else perished, and he remained, / should still 
continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the 
universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part 
of it. My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will 
change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for 
Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little 
visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, 
always in mj mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a 
pleasure to myself, but as my own being." 1 

and Heathcliff cries, when Catherine is dying: "I cannot live 
without my life, I cannot live without my soul." 2 What is 
conveyed to us here is the sense of an affinity deeper than 
sexual attraction, something which it is not enough to describe 
as romantic love. 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 143 

This affinity is forged in rebellion and, in order to grasp 
the concrete and un romantic nature of this book, it is necessary 
to recall the nature of that rebellion. Heathcliff, the waif from 
the Liverpool slums, is treated kindly by old Mr. Earnshaw 
but insulted and degraded by Hindley. After his father's 
death Hindley reduces the boy to the status of a serf. "He 
drove him from their company to the servants, deprived him 
of the instructions of the curate, and insisted that he should 
labour out of doors instead; compelling him to do so as hard 
as any other hand on the farm." 3 The situation at Wuthering 
Heights is wonderfully evoked in the passage from Catherine's 
journal, which Lockwood finds in his bedroom: 

" 'An awful Sunday!' commenced the paragraph beneath. 'I 
wish my father were back again. Hindley is a detestable substitute 
his conduct to Heathcliff is atrocious H. and I are going to rebel 
we took our initiatory step this evening. 

'All day had been flooding with rain; we could not go to church, 
so Joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret, and, while 
Hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable fire 
doing anything but reading the Bibles, I'll answer for it Heathcliff , 
myself, and the unhappy plough-boy, were commanded to take our 
Prayer-books, and mount: were ranged in a row, on a sack of corn, 
groaning and shivering, and hoping that Joseph would shiver too, 
so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake. A vain idea! 
The service lasted precisely three hours: and yet my brother had the 
face to exclaim, when he saw us descending, "What, done already?" 
On Sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play, if we did not 
make much noise; now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into 
corners! 

* " Youforget you have a master here,"says thetyrant.'Tlldemolish 
the first who puts me out of temper! I insist on perfect sobriety and 
silence. Oh, boy! was that you? Frances darling, pull his hair as you 
go by: I heard him snap his fingers." Frances pulled his hair heartily, 
and then went and seated herself on her husband's knee: and there 
they were, like two babies, kissing and talking nonsense by the hour 
foolish palaver that we should be ashamed of. We made ourselves 
as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser. I had just 
fastened our pinafores together, and hung them up for a curtain, 
when in comes Joseph on an errand from the stables. He tears down 
my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks 

' "T 5 maister nobbut just buried, and Sabbath no o'ered, and 



144 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

t' sound o 5 t' gospel still i' yer lugs, and ye darr be laiking! Shame 
on ye! Sit ye down, ill childer! There's good books enough if ye'll 
read em! sit ye down, and think of yer sowls!' " 

'Saying this, he compelled us so to square our positions that 
we might receive from the far-off fire a dull ray to show us the text 
of the lumber he thrust upon us. I could not bear the employment. 
I took my dingy volume by the scroop, and hurled it into the dog- 
kennel, vowing I hated a good book. Heathcliff kicked his to the same 
place. Then there was a hubbub! 

'"MaisterHindley!" shouted our chaplain."Maister,coomhither! 
Miss Cathy's riven th' back of 'Th' Helmet O' Salvation/ un 
HeathclifFs pawsed his fit into t' first part o' 'T' Brooad Way to 
Destruction.' It's fair flaysome, that ye let 'em go on this gait. 
Ech! th' owd man wad ha' laced 'em properly but he's goan!" 

'Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth, and seizing 
one of us by the collar, and the other by the arm, hurled both into 
the back kitchen, where, Joseph asseverated, "owd Nick" would 
fetch us as sure as we were living, and, so comforted, we each sought 
a separate nook to await his advent.' " 4 

This passage reveals, in itself, a great deal of the extraordinary 
quality of Wuihering Heights. It is a passage which, in the 
typical manner of the novel, evokes, in language which involves 
the kind of attention we give to poetry, a world far larger than 
the scene it describes, and evokes it through the very force and 
concreteness of the particular scene. The rebellion of Catherine 
and Heathcliff is made completely concrete. They are not 
vague romantic dreamers. Their rebellion is against the regime 
in which Hindley and his wife sit in fatuous comfort by the 
fire whilst they are relegated to the arch of the dresser and 
compelled for the good of their souls to read the Broad Way 
to Destruction under the tutelage of the canting hypocrite 
Joseph. It is a situation not confined, in the year 1847, to ^ 
more distant homesteads of the Yorkshire moors. 

Against this degradation Catherine and Heathcliff rebel, 
hurling their pious books into the dog-kennel. And in their 
revolt they discover their deep and passionate need of each 
other. He, the outcast shimmy, turns to the lively, spirited, 
fearless girl who alone offers him human understanding and 
comradeship. And she, born into the world of Wuthering 
Heights, senses that to achieve a full humanity, to be true to 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 145 

herself as a human being, she must associate herself totally 
with him in his rebellion against the tyranny of the Earnshaws 
and all that tyranny involves. 

It is this rebellion that immediately, in this early section 
of the book, wins over our sympathy to Heathcliff. We know 
he is on the side of humanity and we are with him just as we 
are with Oliver Twist, and for much the same reasons. But 
whereas Oliver is presented with a sentimental passivity, which 
limits our concern, Heathcliff is active and intelligent and able 
to carry the positive values of human aspiration on his shoulders. 
He is a conscious rebel. And it is from his association in 
rebellion with Catherine that the particular quality of their 
relationship arises. It is the reason why each feels that a 
betrayal of what binds them together is in some obscure and 
mysterious way a betrayal of everything, of all that is most 
valuable in life and death. 

Yet Catherine betrays Heathcliff and marries Edgar 
Linton, kidding herself that she can keep them both, and then 
discovering that in denying Heathcliff she has chosen death. 
The conflict here is, quite explicitly, a social one. Thrushcross 
Grange, embodying as it does the prettier, more comfortable 
side of bourgeois life, seduces Catherine. She begins to despise 
Heathcliff 's lack of 'culture.' He has no conversation, he does 
not brush his hair, he is dirty, whereas Edgar, besides being 
handsome, "will be rich and I shall like to be the greatest 
woman of the neighbourhood, and I shall be proud of having 
such a husband." 6 And so Heathcliff runs away and Catherine 
becomes mistress of Thrushcross Grange. 

Heathcliff returns, adult and prosperous, and at once the 
social conflict is re-emphasized. Edgar, understandably, does 
not want to receive Heathcliff, but Catherine is insistent: 

" 'I know you didn't like him,* she answered, repressing a little the 
intensity of her delight. 'Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now. 
Shall I tell him to come up? ' 

'Here,' he said, 'into the parlour?' 

'Where else? 'she asked. 

He looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable 
place for him. Mrs. Linton eyed him with a droll expression half 
angry, half laughing at his fastidiousness. 



146 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

'No,' she added after a while; 'I cannot sit in the kitchen. Set 
two tables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, being 
gentry, the other for Heathcliff and myself, being the lower orders. 
Will that please you, dear? . . . ' " 6 

And from the moment of Heathcliff's reappearance Catherine's 
attempts to reconcile herself to Thrushcross Grange are 
doomed. In their relationship now there is no tenderness, 
they trample on each other's nerves, madly try to destroy each 
other; but, once Heathcliff is near, Catherine can maintain no 
illusions about the Lintons. The two are united only in their 
contempt for the values of Thrushcross Grange. "There it 
is," Catherine taunts Edgar, speaking of her grave, "not 
among the Lintons, mind, under the chapel roof, but in the 
open air, with a headstone." 7 The open air, nature, the moors 
are contrasted with the world of Thrushcross Grange. And 
the contempt for the Lintons is a moral contempt, not a jealous 
one. When Nelly tells Heathcliff that Catherine is going mad, 
his comment is: 

" 'You talk of her mind being unsettled. How the devil could it 
be otherwise in her frightful isolation? And that insipid paltry 
creature attending her from duty and humanity I From pity and 
charityl He might as well plant an oak in a flower pot, and expect it 
to thrive, as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his 
shallow cares!' " 8 

The moral passion here is so intense, so deeply imbedded 
in the rhythm and imagery of the prose, that it is easy to be 
swept along without grasping its full and extraordinary signifi- 
cance. Heathcliff at this point has just perpetrated the first of 
his callous and ghastly acts of revenge, his marriage to Isabella. 
It is an act so morally repulsive that it is almost inconceivable 
that we should be able now to take seriously his attack on 
Edgar Linton, who has, after all, by conventional, respectable 
standards, done nobody any harm. And yet we do take the 
attack seriously because Emily Bronte makes us. The passion 
of the passage just quoted has the quality of great poetry. Why? 

We continue to sympathize with Heathcliff, even after his 
marriage with Isabella, because Emily Bronte convinces us 
that what Heathcliff stands for is morally superior to what 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 147 

the Lintons stand for. This is, it must be insisted, not a case 
of some mysterious 'emotional* power with which Heathcliff 
is charged. The emotion behind his denunciation of Edgar is 
moral emotion. The words "duty" and "humanity," "pity" 
and "charity" have precisely the kind of force Blake gives 
such words in his poetry.* 

They are used not so much paradoxically as in a sense 
inverted but more profound than the conventional usage. 
Heathcliff speaks, apparently paradoxically, of Catherine's 
"frightful isolation," when to all appearances she is in Thrush- 
cross Grange less isolated, more subject to care and society, 
than she could possibly be with him. But in truth Heathcliff J s 
assertion is a paradox only to those who do not understand his 
meaning. What he is asserting with such intense emotional 
conviction that we, too, are convinced, is that what he stands 
for, the alternative life he has offered Catherine is more natural 
(the image of the oak enforces this), more social and more 
moral than the world of Thrushcross Grange. Most of those 
who criticize Heathcliff adversely (on the grounds that he is 
unbelievable, or that he is a neurotic creation, or that he is 
merely the Byronic satan-hero revived) fail to appreciate his 
significance because they fail to recognize this moral force. 
And as a rule they fail to recognize the moral force because 
they are themselves, consciously or not, of the Linton party. 

The climax of this inversion by Heathcliff and Catherine 
of the common standards of bourgeois morality comes at the 
death of Catherine. To recognize the revolutionary force of this 
scene one has only to imagine what a different novelist might 
have made of it. 

The stage is all set for a moment of conventional drama. 
Catherine is dying, Heathcliff appears out of the night. Two 
possibilities present themselves: either Catherine will at the 
last reject Heathcliff, the marriage vow will be vindicated and 

* E.g. Pity would be no more 

If we did not make somebody Poor, 

And Mercy no more could be 

If all were as happy as we 
or

Give any proofs of Humility. 



148 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

wickedness meet its reward; or true love will triumph and 
reconciliation proclaim the world well lost. It is hard to imagine 
that either possibility ever crossed Emily Bronte's mind, for 
either would destroy the pattern of her book, but her rejection 
of them is a measure of her moral and artistic power. For 
instead of its conventional potentialities the scene acquires an 
astonishing moral power. Heathcliff confronted with the dying 
Catherine, is ruthless, morally ruthless: instead of easy comfort 
he offers her a brutal analysis of what she has done. 

" 'You teach me now how cruel you've been cruel and false. 
Why did you despise me? Why did you betray your own heart 
Cathy? I have not one word of comfort. You deserve this. You have 
killed yourself. Yes, you may kiss me, and cry: and wring out my 
kisses and tears: they'll blight you they'll damn you. You loved 
me then what right had you to leave me? What right answer me 
for the poor fancy you felt for Linton? Because misery and degra- 
dation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict 
would have parted us, you, of your own will, did it. I have not 
broken your heart you have broken it; and in breaking it you have 
broken mine. So much the worse that I am strong. Do I want to 
live? What kind of living will it be when you oh, God! would you 
like to live with your soul in the grave? ' " 9 

It is one of the harshest passages in all literature, but it is also 
one of the most moving. For the brutality is not neurotic, nor 
sadistic, nor romantic. The Catherine-Heathcliff relationship, 
standing as it does for a humanity finer and more morally 
profound than the standards of the Lintons and Earnshaws 
has to undergo the kind of examination Heathcliff here brings 
to it. Anything less, anything which smudged or sweetened the 
issues involved, would be inadequate, unworthy. Heathcliff 
knows that nothing can save Catherine from death but that one 
thing alone can give her peace, a full and utterly honest under- 
standing and acceptance of their relationship and what it 
implies. There is no hope in comfort or compromise. Any 
such weakness would debase them both and make a futile waste 
of their lives and death. For Heathcliff and Catherine, who 
reject the Lintons 5 chapel roof and the consolations of 
Christianity, know, too, that their relationship is more impor- 
tant than death. 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 149 

In the section of the book that follows Catherine's death 
Heathcliff continues the revenge he has begun with his marriage 
to Isabella. It is the most peculiar section of the novel and the 
most difficult because the quality of Heathcliff 's feeling is of a 
kind most of us find hard to comprehend. All normal and 
healthy human feeling is rejected. He cries: 

" 'I have no pity! I have no pity! The more the worms writhe, 
the more I yearn to crush out their entrails! It is a moral teething; 
and I grind with greater energy, in proportion to the increase of 
pain/" 10 

"It is a moral teething" the phrase is both odd and 
significant, giving as it does the answer to our temptation to 
treat this whole section as a delineation of pathological neurosis. 
Heathcliff becomes a monster: what he does to Isabella, to 
Hareton, to Cathy, to his son, even to the wretched Hindley, is 
cruel and inhuman beyond normal thought. He seems con- 
cerned to achieve new refinements of horror, new depths of 
degradation. And we tend to feel, perhaps, unless we read with 
full care and responsiveness, that Emily Bronte has gone too 
far, that the revenge (especially the marriage of Cathy and 
Linton Heathcliff) has o'erflown the measure. 

And yet it is only one side of our minds, the conscious, 
limited side that refers what we are reading to our everyday 
measures of experience that makes this objection. Another side, 
which is more completely responding to Emily Bronte's art, 
is carried on. And the astonishing achievement of this part of 
the book is that, despite our protests about probability (protests 
which, incidentally, a good deal of twentieth-century history 
makes a little complacent), despite everything he does and is, 
we continue to sympathize with Heathcliff not, obviously, to 
admire him or defend him, but to give him our inmost 
sympathy, to continue in an obscure way to identify ourselves 
with him against the other characters. 

The secret of this achievement lies in such a phrase as "it 
is a moral teething" and in the gradually clarifying pattern of 
the book. Heathcliff' s revenge may involve a pathological 
condition of hatred, but it is not at bottom merely neurotic. 
It has a moral force. For what Heathcliff does is to use against 



150 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

his enemies with complete ruthlessness their own weapons, to 
turn on them (stripped of their romantic veils) their own 
standards, to beat them at their own game. The weapons he 
uses against the Earnshaws and Lintons are their own weapons 
of money and arranged marriages. He gets power over them by 
the classic methods of the ruling class, expropriation and 
property deals. He buys out Hindley and reduces him to 
drunken impotency, he marries Isabella and then organizes the 
marriage of his son to Catherine Linton, so that the entire 
property of the two families shall be controlled by himself. 
He systematically degrades Hareton Earnshaw to servility 
and illiteracy. "I want the triumph of seeing my descendant 
fairly lord of their estates! My child hiring their children to till 
their father's lands for wages." 11 (This is a novel which, some 
critics will tell you, has nothing to do with anything as humdrum 
as society or life as it is actually lived.) And what particularly 
tickles HeathclifFs fancy is his achievement of the supreme 
ruling-class triumph of making Hareton, the boy he degrades, 
feel a deep and even passionate attachment towards himself. 

Heathcliff retains our sympathy throughout this dreadful 
section of the book because instinctively we recognize a 
rough moral justice in what he has done to his oppressors and 
because, though he is inhuman, we understand why he is 
inhuman. Obviously we do not approve of what he does, but 
we understand it; the deep and complex issues behind his 
actions are revealed to us. We recognize that the very forces 
which drove him to rebellion for a higher freedom have them- 
selves entrapped him in their own values and determined the 
nature of his revenge. 

If Wuthering Heights were to stop at this point it would still 
be a great book, but a wholly sombre and depressing one. Man 
would be revealed as inevitably caught up in the meshes of 
his own creating; against the tragic horror of HeathclifFs 
appalling rebellion the limited but complacent world of 
Thrushcross Grange would seem a tempting haven and the 
novel would resolve itself into the false antithesis of Thrush- 
cross Grange/Wuthering Heights, just as in Oliver Twist the 
real antithesis becomes sidetracked into the false one of 
Brownlow/Fagin. But Wuthering Heights, a work of supreme 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 151 

and astonishing genius, does not stop here. We have not done 
with Heathcliff yet. 

For at the moment of his horrible triumph a change begins 
to come over Heathcliff. 

" 'It is a poor conclusion, is it not? ' he observed, having brooded 
a while on the scene he had just witnessed: 'an absurd termination to 
my violent exertions? I get levers and mattocks to demolish the two 
houses, and train myself to be capable of working like Hercules, 
and when everything is ready and in my power, I find the will to lift 
a slate off either roof has vanished! My old enemies have not beaten 
me; now would be the precise time to revenge myself on their 
representatives: I could do it, and none could hinder me. But where is 
the use? I don't care for striking; I can't take the trouble to raise my 
hand! That sounds as if I had been labouring the whole time only to 
exhibit a fine trait of magnanimity. It is far from being the case: I 
have lost the faculty of enjoying their destruction, and I am too idle 
to destroy for nothing. 

'Nelly, there is a strange change approaching: I'm in its shadow 
at present.' " 12 

and he goes on to speak of Cathy and Hareton, who "seemed a 
personification of my youth, not a human being." "Hareton's 
aspect was the ghost of my immortal love; of my wild endeavour 
to hold my right; my degradation, my pride, my happiness and 
my anguish." When Nelly asks "But what do you mean by a 
change, Mr. Heathcliff?" he can only answer "I shall not know 
that till it comes," he said "I'm only half conscious of it now." 
Once more the stage is set for a familiar scene, the conversion 
of the wicked who will in the final chapter turn from his 
wickedness. And once more the conventional must look again. 
The change that comes over Heathcliff and the novel and 
leads us on to the wonderful, quiet, gentle, tentative evocation 
of nature in the final sentence, is a very subtle one. It has some- 
thing of the quality of the last two acts of The Winter's Tale 
but is much less complete, less confident. Mr. Klingopulos in 
his interesting essay on Wuthering Heights** has commented on 
the ambiguous nature of this final tranquillity. I do not agree 
with his analysis but he has caught the tone most convincingly. 
Heathcliff, watching the love of Cathy and Hareton grow, 
comes to understand something of the failure of his own 



152 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

revenge. As Cathy teaches Hareton to write and stops laughing 
at his ignorance we too are taken back to the first Catherine. 

Cathy and Hareton are not in the novel an easy re-creation 
of Catherine and Heathcliff; they are, as Mr. Klingopulos 
remarks, different people, even lesser people, certainly people 
conceived on a less intense and passionate scale than the older 
lovers. But they do symbolize the continuity of life and human 
aspirations, and it is through them that Heathcliff comes to 
understand the hollowness of his triumph. It is when Hareton, 
who loves him, comes to Cathy's aid when he strikes her that 
the full meaning of his own relationship with Catherine comes 
back to him and he becomes aware that in the feeling between 
Cathy and Hareton there is something of the same quality. 
From the moment that Cathy and Hareton are drawn together 
as rebels the change begins. For now for the first time Heathcliff 
is confronted not with those who accept the values of Wuthering 
Heights and Thrushcross Grange but with those who share, 
however remotely, his own wild endeavours to hold his right. 

Heathcliff does not repent. Nelly tries to make him turn to 
the consolations of religion. 

" 'You are aware, Mr. Heathcliff,' I said, 'that from the time 
you were thirteen years old, you have lived a selfish, unchristian 
life; and probably hardly had a Bible in your hands during all that 
period. You must have forgotten the contents of the Book, and you 
may not have space to search it now. Could it be hurtful to send for 
some one some minister of any denomination, it does not matter 
which to explain it, and show you how very far you have erred 
from its precepts; and how unfit you will be for its heaven, unless a 
change takes place before you die? ' 

'I'm rather obliged than angry, Nelly,' he said, 'for you remind 
me of the manner in which I desire to be buried. It is to be carried 
to the churchyard in the evening. You and Hareton may, if you 
please, accompany me: and mind, particularly, to notice that the 
sexton obeys my directions concerning the two coffins! No minister 
need come; nor need anything be said over me. I tell you I have 
nearly attained my heaven, and that of others is altogether unvalued 
and uncoveted by me.' " 14 

One sentence here, in its limpid simplicity, especially evokes the 
state of mind Heathcliff has come to. He speaks of the manner 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 153 

in which he wishes to be buried. "It is to be carried to the 
churchyard in the evening." The great rage has died in him. 
He has come to see the pointlessness of his fight to revenge 
himself on the world of power and property through its own 
values. Just as Catherine had to face the full moral horror of 
her betrayal of their love, he must face the full horror of his 
betrayal too. And once he has faced it he can die, not nobly or 
triumphantly, but at least as a man, leaving with Cathy and 
Hareton the possibility of carrying on the struggle he has begun, 
and in his death he will achieve again human dignity, "to be 
carried to the churchyard in the evening." 

It is this re-achievement of manhood by Heathcliff, an 
understanding reached with no help from the world he despises, 
which, together with the developing relationship of Cathy and 
Hareton and the sense of the continuity of life in nature, gives to 
the last pages of Wuthering Heights a sense of positive and 
unsentimental hope. The Catherine-Heathcliff relationship has 
been vindicated. Life will go on and others will rebel against 
the oppressors. Nothing has been solved but much has been 
experienced. Lies, complacencies and errors, appalling errors, 
have been revealed. A veil has been drawn from the conven- 
tional face of bourgeois man; he has been revealed, through 
Heathcliff, without his mask. 

Above all, the quality of the feeling that binds Catherine 
and Heathcliff has been conveyed to us. Their love, which 
Heathcliff can without idealism call immortal, is something 
beyond the individualist dream of two soul-mates finding full 
realization in one another; it is an expression of the necessity ot 
man, if he is to choose life rather than death, to revolt against 
all that would destroy his inmost needs and aspirations, of the 
necessity of all human beings to become, through acting 
together, more fully human. Catherine, responding to this deep 
human necessity, rebels with Heathcliff but in marrying 
Edgar (a 'good' marriage if ever there was one) betrays her 
own humanity; Heathcliff, by revenging himself on the tyrants 
through the adoption of their own standards makes more clear 
those standards but betrays too his humanity and destroys his 
relationship with the dead Catherine whose spirit must haunt 
the moors in terror and dismay. 



154 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

Only when the new change has come over Heathcliff and 
he again recognizes through Hareton (and remotely, therefore, 
through Catherine herself) the full claims of humanity can 
Catherine be released from torment and their relationship 
re-established. Death is a matter of little importance in 
Wuthering Heights because the issues the novel is concerned 
with are greater than the individual life and death. The deaths 
of Catherine and Heathcliff are indeed a kind of triumph 
because ultimately each faces death honestly, keeping faith. 
But there is no suggestion that death itself is a triumph: on the 
contrary it is life that asserts itself, continues, blossoms again. 

Mr. David Wilson in his excellent essay on Emily Bronte 15 to 
which I am deeply indebted (though I do not agree with all of 
his interpretation) suggests an identification, not necessarily 
conscious in Emily Bronte's mind, of Heathcliff with the 
rebellious working men of the hungry 'forties' and of Catherine 
with that part of the educated class which felt compelled to 
identify itself with their cause. Such a formulation, suggestive 
as it is, seems to me to be too far removed from the actual 
impact of Wuthering Heights as a novel, to be satisfactory. But 
Mr. Wilson has done a valuable service in rescuing Wuthering 
Heights from the transcendentalists and in insisting on the 
place of Haworth (generally assumed to be a remote country 
village) in the industrial revolution and its attendant social 
unrest.* The value of his suggestion with regard to Heathcliff 
and Catherine seems to me in the emphasis it gives to the 
concrete, local particularity of the book. 

It is very necessary to be reminded that just as the values of 
Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange are not simply the 
values of any tyranny but specifically those of Victorian society, 
so is the rebellion of Heathcliff a particular rebellion, that of 
the worker physically and spiritually degraded by the con- 
ditions and relationships of this same society. That Heathcliff 
ceases to be one of the exploited is true, but it is also true that 
just in so far as he adopts (with a ruthlessness that frightens 
even the ruling class itself) the standards of the ruling class, 

* One of the most interesting exhibits in the Haworth museum today is a 
proclamation of the Queen ordering the reading of the Riot Act against the 
rebellious workers of the West Riding. 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 155 

so do the human values implicit in his early rebellion and in his 
love for Catherine vanish. All that is involved in the Catherine- 
Heathcliff relationship, all that it stands for in human needs 
and hopes, can be realized only through the active rebellion of 
the oppressed. 

Wuthering Heights then is an expression in the imaginative 
terms of art of the stresses and tensions and conflicts, personal 
and spiritual, of nineteenth-century capitalist society. It is a 
novel without idealism, without false comforts, without any 
implication that power over their destinies rests outside the 
struggles and actions of human beings themselves. Its powerful 
evocation of nature, of moorland and storm, of the stars and the 
seasons is an essential part of its revelation of the very movement 
of life itself. The men and women of Wuthering Heights are 
not the prisoners of nature; they live in the world and strive to 
change it, sometimes successfully, always painfully, with almost 
infinite difficulty and error. 

This unending struggle, of which the struggle to advance 
from class society to the higher humanity of a classless world is 
but an episode, is conveyed to us in Wuthering Heights precisely 
because the novel is conceived in actual, concrete, particular 
terms, because the quality of oppression revealed in the novel 
is not abstract but concrete, not vague but particular. And that 
is why Emily Bronte's novel is at the same time a statement 
about the life she knew, the life of Victorian England, and a 
statement about life as such. Virginia Woolf, writing about it, 
said: 

"That gigantic ambition is to be felt throughout the novel, a 
struggle half thwarted but of superb conviction, to say something 
through the mouths of characters which is not merely 'I love* or 
'I hate* but 'we, the whole human race* and 'You; the eternal 
powers . . .* the sentence remains unfinished." 16 

I do not think it remains unfinished. 



VI. THACKERAY: VANITY FAIR 
(1847-8) 

THACKERAY'S method in Vanity Fair is in all essentials the 
method of Fielding in Tom Jones. To call the method panoramic, 
as many critics do (and in particular Mr. Percy Lubbock in 
The Craft of Fiction) is true but can be misleading. It is true in 
the sense that Thackeray's vision shifts about, that he surveys 
a broad field of territory and that the reader is kept at a certain 
distance from the scene. 

The core of Vanity Fair is not a developing emotional 
situation involving the intense experience of a limited number 
of characters. We do not get 'inside* one particular character 
and see the action through the imprint upon his consciousness, 
nor do we become so closely involved in a concrete situation 
(seeing it, so to speak, backward and forward and from many 
angles) that we have a sense of encompassing the whole complex 
of forces that makes such a situation vital. Even at a big dramatic 
moment, such as the famous scene when Rawdon Crawley 
returns from the spunging-house and finds Becky and Lord 
Steyne together, we do not have the effect of a vital clash of 
conflicting forces. 

We wonder what is going to happen, we relish the theatrical 
quality of the scene; but our emotions are not deeply engaged 
because we know that nothing truly disturbing or exquisitely 
comic will be revealed; nothing will be changed, neither Becky 
nor Rawdon nor Steyne nor us. Even the ambiguity which 
Thackeray is at pains to achieve "was Becky innocent?" 
does not succeed in making us look at the scene in a fresh 
way, because the issue is morally a false one. Whether Becky is 
actually Steyne's mistress or not scarcely matters. And 
Thackeray knows it scarcely matters; with the result that the 
raising of the issue gives the impression of a sexual archness 

156 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 157 

rather than that of a genuine ambiguity, the effect of which 
would be, by raising an important doubt in our mind, to make 
us suddenly see the episode in a new way, with a new flash of 
insight. 

Everything in Vanity Fair remains at a distance because 
between the scene and the reader there always stands, with an 
insistent solidity, Thackeray himself. Of course it is true that 
every novelist stands between the scene of his novel and the 
reader, controlling and directing our attention. But by a Jane 
Austen or an EmUy Bronte or a Dickens the directing is done, 
not necessarily unobtrusively (we are always aware of Dickens 
especially), but with an eye primarily on the object or the scene 
that is being revealed, whereas with Thackeray one has 
constantly the sense that the scene itself is less important than 
something else. 

Take, for instance, the very first episode of Vanity Fair, 
the great scene of the departure of Amelia and Becky from Miss 
Pinkerton's academy in Chiswick Mall, at the climax of which 
Becky throws the dictionary out of the coach window into the 
garden. It is a beautifully and dramatically conceived scene, 
an episode that is to tell us more about Becky than fifty pages 
of reminiscence; but notice how Thackeray handles the 
climax: 

"Sambo of the bandy legs slammed the carriage-door on his 
young weeping mistress. He sprang up behind the carriage. 'Stop!' 
cried Miss Jemima, rushing to the gate with a parcel. 

'It's some sandwiches, my dear,* said she to Amelia. *You may 
be hungry, you know; and Becky, Becky Sharp, here's a book for 
you that my sister that is, I, Johnson's Dictionary, you know; 
you mustn't leave us without that. Good-bye. Drive on, coachman. 
God bless you!' 

And the kind creature retreated into the garden, overcome with 
emotions. 

But, lo! and just as the coach drove off, Miss Sharp put her pale 
face out of the window, and actually flung the book back into the 
garden. 

This almost caused Jemima to faint with terror. 

'Well, I never,' said she; 'what an audacious ' Emotion 
prevented her. from completing either sentence. The carriage 
rolled away. . . ." L 



158 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

This is excellent, but there is one word in the passage that 
prevents the scene from being fully dramatic and stops it 
achieving its potential force the word "actually" in the 
sentence describing the flinging of the book* This one word 
colours the scene, investing it with a sense of scandalized 
amazement which may well reflect Miss Jemima's feelings but 
which weakens (not disastrously, of course, but appreciably) 
the objective force of the episode. After all, we know without 
that adverb what Miss Jemima's feelings are; its only function 
in the description is in fact to bring a particular colouring to 
the scene. It is Thackeray who steps in and in stepping in 
reduces the whole episode. The tone of that "actually" is the 
tone that puts almost everything in Vanity Fair at a distance. 

Does it necessarily matter, this distancing of a novel by its 
author? I do not think it matters at all if it is a successful part 
of a consistent plan. Fielding achieves it very successfully in 
Tom Janes, so does Samuel Butler in the greater part of The 
Way of All Flesh. But the method, it must be recognized, puts 
an enormous strain on the author. If we are to be constantly 
seeing a novel through a kind of haze of reflectiveness spread 
around it by the author, then the comments, the reflections, the 
qualities of mind of the writer have got to be distinguished by 
quite remarkable understanding and control. We have seen 
how, in Oliver Twist, the conscious attitudes of Dickens are 
very frequently inadequate to what he is portraying. With 
Dickens this does not matter very much because his dramatic 
method concentrates the whole attention on the developing 
scene and makes the comment unimportant (one can mentally 
skip it without doing violence to the novel). 

But with Thackeray's method the opposite holds. Every- 
thing depends on the capacity of the novelist to encompass in 
his own personality an adequate attitude to what he is describ- 
ing. If he succeeds he will indeed cast around his puppets that 
understanding and humanity which (in Henry James's words 
about Fielding) do "somehow really enlarge, make everyone 
and everything important." But if his attitudes are less than 
adequate, then by driving his characters into the distance he 
will be weakening his whole effect. 

The description "panoramic" may become misleading when 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 159 

applied to Vanity Fair if the word suggests that the individual 
characters in Thackeray's novel are not important, that the 
book has anything of the nature of the documentary. Mr. 
Lubbock (whose pages on Thackeray are consistently stimulat- 
ing) seems to me on rather dangerous ground when he writes: 

"Not in any single complication of incident, therefore, nor in any 
single strife of will, is the subject of Vanity Fair to be discerned. It is 
nowhere but in the impression of a world, a society, a time certain 
manners of life within a few square miles of London, a hundred 
years ago. Thackeray flings together a crowd of the people he knows 
so well, and it matters not at all if the tie that holds them to each other 
is of the slightest; it may easily chance that his good young girl and 
his young adventuress set out together on their journey, their paths 
may even cross from time to time later on. The light link is enough 
for the unity of his tale, for that unity does not depend on an intri- 
cately woven intrigue. It depends in truth upon one fact only, the 
fact that all his throng of men and women are strongly, picturesquely 
typical of the world from which they are taken, that all in their 
different ways can add to the force of its effect. The book is not the 
story of any one of them, it is the story that they unite to tell, a chapter 
in the notorious career of well-to-do London." 2 

There is so much that is true here that it may seem a little 
pedantic and ungenerous to insist that it is not altogether 
helpful. It is indeed true that the subject of Vanity Fair is a 
society the world of well-to-do Britain (not merely London) 
at the beginning of the last century. But it is also true that this 
subject is seen in terms not of a general impression but of 
specific human relationships. "An impression of manners" is 
not an accurate description. As we look back on Thackeray's 
novel we recall a whole world, a bustling, lively, crowded world; 
but we recall it in terms of individual people and their relation- 
ships. These people are presented to us, by and large, in the 
tradition of the comedy of humours. That is to say each has 
particular characteristics, somewhat exaggerated and simplified, 
by which they are easily comprehensible. 

"These characters are almost always static," Mr. Edwin Muir 
has said. "They are like a familiar landscape, which now and then 
surprises us when a particular effect of light or shadow alters it, or 
we see it from a new prospect. Amelia Sedley, George Osborne, 



l6o AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

Becky Sharp, Rawdon Crawley these do not change as Eustacia 
Vye and Catherine Earnshaw do; the alteration they undergo is less 
a temporal one than an unfolding in a continuously widening present. 
Their weaknesses, their vanities, their foibles, thej possess from the 
beginning and never lose to the end; and what actually does change is 
not these, but our knowledge of them." 3 

This is, broadly speaking, true, but not quite fair. Some of the 
characters in Vanity Fair do change; Pitt Crawley, for instance, 
who begins as a simple unworldly prig, blossoms out with a 
fortune into an ambitious worldly idiot, and yet remains the 
same person, and particularly Amelia who, in her infuriating 
way, develops a good deal in the course of the novel.* The 
important point, however, is that Thackeray's puppets (it is a 
pity he used the word, for it has encouraged an underestimation 
of his subtlety) are all involved in human relationships which, 
though not presented with much intimacy or delicacy of 
analysis, are for the most part true and convincing relationships. 
We know, for instance, quite precisely enough the quality 
of George Osborne's feeling for Amelia or of Rawdon's for 
Becky. The latter relationship could scarcely be better illus- 
trated than by the letter Rawdon writes from the spunging- 
house: 

" 'Dear Becky' (Rawdon wrote), 'I hope you slept well. Don't 
be frightened if I don't bring you in your cqffy. Last night as I was 
coming home smoaking, I met with an aecadent. I was nabbed by 
Moss of Cursitor Street from whose gilt and splendid parler I 
write this the same that had me this time two years. Miss Moss 
brought in my tea she is grown very fat , and as usual, had her 
stockens down at heed. 

'It's Nathan's business a hundred and fifty with costs, 
hundred and seventy. Please send me my desk and some cloths 
I'm in pumps and a white tye (something like Miss M's stockings) 
I've seventy in it. And as soon as you get this, Drive to Nathan's 
offer him seventy-five down, and ask him to renew say I'll take 
wine we may as well have some dinner sherry; but not ptcturs, 
they're too dear. 

* One or two characters change quite unconvincingly, not because they 
develop organically but because Thackeray seems to change his plans for 
them half-way through. Lady Jane Sheepshanks (who marries Pitt Crawley) 
is one of these. Some critics consider that Amelia changes in this way only, 
but I think the evidence is against them. 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY l6l 

'If he won't stand it. Take my ticker and such of your things as 
you can spare, and send them to Balls we must, of coarse, have the 
sum to-night. It won't do to let it stand over, as to-morrow's Sunday, 
the beds here are not very clean, and there may be other things out 
against me I'm glad it an't Rawdon's Saturday for coming home. 
God bless you. 

'Yours in haste, 

*R.c. 

*P.S. Make haste and come." 4 

Every sentence of this is masterly. Thackeray is marvellously 
good at depicting typical upper-class young men the sketch 
of James Crawley with his "dawgs" is a delightful minor 
example the kind of people of whom Matthew Arnold wrote 
"One has often wondered whether upon the whole earth there is 
anything so unintelligent, so unapt to perceive how the world 
is really going, as an ordinary young Englishman of our upper 
class." 6 Now it is true that we do not enter intimately into 
the feelings of any of thes6 characters, but it would be wrong 
to suppose they are any the less human. When we say we know 
the quality of their feelings what we mean is that we know all 
about those feelings, not that we share them in the way we 
share Emma's responses. But it is not, even in the very broadest 
sense, their manners that are the subject of the book. 

The central relationship with which Thackeray, like 
Fielding and Richardson and Jane Austen, is concerned is 
marriage. Vanity Fair is about the difficulties of personal 
relationships, particularly marriage relationships, m nineteenth- 
century, upper-class English society. It is a well-organized 
novel despite its discursiveness and some lapses in construction 
(the most clumsy being the return to England of Dobbin and 
Joseph Sedley; the chronology and therefore what has been 
well called the choreography is very confused here). The 
planning of the double story of Becky and Amelia is by no 
means as casual as Mr. Lubbock would seem to suggest. Not 
only do the two girls stand in a complementary relation to each 
other the one active and 'bad,' the other passive and 'good' 
but their careers are juxtaposed in contrasting curves of 
development, Becky's curve rising in the centre of the book, 
Amelia's declining. The fact that from the death of George at 



I&2 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

Waterloo to the reunion at Pumpernickel the two women 
scarcely meet does not weaken the pattern of the book nor blur 
the underlying contrast between them, for each is playing her 
necessary part. 

Lord David Cecil in his essay on Thackeray notices the 
strong pattern of the book but seems curiously imperceptive as 
to its significance. 

"The characters of the two girls are designed to illustrate the 
laws controlling Vanity Fair as forcibly as possible. And in order to 
reveal how universally these laws work, they are of strongly- 
contrasted types. 

Amelia is an amiable character, simple, modest and unselfish. 
But, says Thackeray, in Vanity Fair such virtue always involves as a 
corollary a certain weakness. Amelia is foolish, feeble and self- 
deceived. She spends a large part of her youth in a devotion, genuine 
enough to begin with, later merely a sentimental indulgence in her 
emotions, to a man unworthy of her. For him she rejects a true 
lover; and though she is ultimately persuaded to marry this lover, it is 
only, ironically enough, through the chance caprice of the woman 
for whom her first love had rejected her. Nor is she wholly saved 
from the punishment of her error. By the time he marries her, her 
true lover has learnt to see her as she is. 

Becky, the second 'heroine* is not weak and self-deceived; she 
is a *bad' character, a wolf not a lamb, artful, bold and unscrupulous. 
But she, no more than Amelia, can escape the laws governing the 
city of her nativity* By nature a Bohemian, she is beguiled, by the 
false glitter surrounding the conventional rank and fashion which 
are the vulgar and predominant idols of Vanity Fair, to spend time 
and energy in trying to attain them. She succeeds, but she is not 
satisfied. Nor is she able to maintain her success. She is too selfish to 
treat the husband, who is necessary to her position, with the 
minimum of consideration necessary to keep him. She sinks to the 
underworld of society. But her eyes are not opened; and the rest of 
her life is spent in trying to retrieve herself, so far successfully that 
we see her last as a charitable dowager, a pattern of respectability, 
a final flamboyant example of the deceptiveness of outward appear- 
ances in Vanity Fair. 

This parallel structure extends to the men who enter Amelia's 
and Becky's lives; they are similarly contrasted, similarly self- 
deceived. . . ."* 

This appears to me a remarkable example of criticism gone 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 163 

wrong, missing the essential point of the novel under considera- 
tion. To write of Becky as "beguiled by the false glitter sur- 
rounding the conventional rank and fashion, etc." is surely to 
miss the vital question: what else could Becky do? And once 
we ask that question it becomes irrelevant to talk of self- 
deception. Lord David Cecil, having insisted that the book 
is about a society, Vanity Fair, then proceeds to abstract the 
characters morally from that society and discuss them as though 
they had any existence outside it. Because he sees the individual 
and society as separate entities and social 'laws' as something 
abstract and distinct from personal moral standards he misses 
the vital motive-force of the novel. 

The trouble with Becky is not that "she is too selfish, etc." 
(It is not selfishness of that type that leads to the intrigue with 
Lord Steyne, nor is the keeping of a husband in that sense 
Becky's greatest necessity.) Becky's dilemma and Amelia's 
for that matter is the dilemma of Jane Fairfax in Emma and 
of almost all the heroines of English fiction from Moll Flanders 
onwards. What is a young woman of spirit and intelligence to 
do in the polite but barbarous world of bourgeois society? 
Only two courses are open to her, the passive one of acquies- 
cence to subjugation or the active one of independent rebellion.* 
The only hope of a compromise solution is the lucky chance 
of finding an understanding man like Mr. Darcy or Mr. 
Knightley, rich enough to buy certain civilized values and kind 
enough to desire them; but the snag is that the Mr. Knightleys 
require something Becky by her very fate (she has had a harder 
fight than Jane Fairfax) can never have "true elegance of 

* It is interesting to notice how in Vanity Fair as in the eighteenth- 
century novels the one thing that none of the important characters (however 
hard pressed) ever contemplates doing is physical work. For a woman the 
job of governess or companion is degradation enough, below that is 
unthinkable, however critical one's situation, and as a last resort prostitution 
is a greatly preferable alternative to labour. As for men, the typical solution 
credit and the generosity of relatives breaking down is a commission in the 
Army. This failing, Newgate or the spunging-house is the next step, with 
the extreme possibility of a life of crime. But no one ever becomes a worker 
and the reason is obvious. Once one had passed from the owning to the 
labouring class one was lost. One never got back and life, to one who had 
once known the standards of the civilized world, was simply not worth 
living. George Osborne found he could not possibly live on two thousand a 
year; but it is left to Amelia to discover that "women arc working hard, and 
better than she can, for twopence a day." (Chap. L.) 



164 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

mind." You cannot pick that up in Soho or slaving for Miss 
Pinkerton. 

Becky, like Moll and Clarissa and Sophia (each after her 
own fashion) before her, rebels. She will not submit to per- 
petual slavery and humiliation within the governess trade. And 
so she uses consciously and systematically all the men's weapons 
plus her one natural material asset, her sex, to storm the men's 
world. And the consequence is of course morally degrading 
and she is a bad woman all right. But she gains our sympathy 
nevertheless not our approving admiration but our human 
fellow-feelingjust as Heathcliff does, and she too gains it not 
in spite but because of her rebellion. She gains it from the 
moment she flings kind Miss Jemima's dictionary out of the 
window and thereby rejects the road that would have led her to 
become a Miss Jemima herself. It is this act that sets in motion 
the vital vibrations of the book, and it is interesting to compare 
it with that other act of rebellion that sets off so vastly different 
a book as Wuthering Heights. 

There is no mystery about the vitality and fascination of 
Becky Sharp. It is not a sentimental sympathy that she 
generates. Thackeray, the Victorian gentleman, may tone down 
her rebellion by ambiguous adverbs and a scandalized titter, 
but the energy he has put into her is more profound than his 
morals or his philosophy and she sweeps him along. Of course 
Becky is unadmirable (though for the moment when she tells 
Amelia the truth about George Osborne, "that selfish humbug, 
that low-bred cockney-dandy, that padded booby, etc.," one 
can forgive her much), but what else could she have been? 

" 'It isn't difficult to be a country gentleman's wife,' Rebecca 
thought. *I think I could be a good woman if I had five thousand a 
year. I could dawdle about in the nursery, and count the apricots 
on the wall. I could water plants in a green-house, and pick off dead 
leaves from the geraniums. I could ask old women about their 
rheumatisms, and order half-a-crown*s worth of soup for the poor. 
I shouldn't miss it much, out of five thousand a year. I could even 
drive out ten miles to dine at a neighbour's, and dress in the 
fashions of the year before last. I could go to church and keep awake 
in the great family pew; or go to sleep behind the curtains and with 
my veil down, if I only had practice. I could pay everybody, if I 
had but the money . . .' " 7 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 165 

In other words she could have been, with luck, someone not 
unlike Mrs. Elton in Emma, though she would have played 
her cards a good deal better. She could alternatively, of course, 
have had a shot at being Amelia. Amelia also could be a very 
good woman (by Victorian standards) on five thousand a year 
and at the conclusion of the book is in this happy condition. 
But not before the consequences of being Amelia have been 
pretty thoroughly shown up, even to the wooden old war-horse, 
Dobbin. 

Amelia is often regarded as one of Thackeray's failures, 
the weak link in Vanity Fair. I think this is because too many 
readers want her to be something she cannot be within the 
pattern of the book a heroine. Certainly as a heroine she cuts 
a very feeble figure. Certainly, too, there is a recurring ambiguity 
in Thackeray's attitude to her. If we tend to think of her as a 
heroine manqu&e it is largely his fault, for in the first part of the 
novel it is hard to believe that his comments on poor, tender, 
abused little Amelia are in any deep sense ironical. And yet if 
we expect too much of Amelia we cannot put all the blame on 
Thackeray. We are warned in the first chapter by the tone of: 
"She had twelve intimate and bosom friends out of the twenty- 
four young ladies ..." And by Chapter XII we should realize 
that Amelia is not being produced for our uncritical approval: 

' ... in the course of a year (love) turned a good young girl into a 
good young woman to be a good wife presently when the happy 
time should come . This young person (perhaps it was very imprudent 
in her parents to encourage her, and abet her in such idolatry and 
silly, romantic ideas), loved, with all her heart, the young officer 
in his Majesty's service with whom we have made a brief acquain- 
tance. She thought about him the very first moment on waking; 
and his was the very last name mentioned in her prayers. She never 
had seen a man so beautiful or so clever; such a figure on horseback: 
such a dancer: such a hero in general. Talk of the Prince's bow! 
what was it to George's? She had seen Mr. Brummell, whom 
everybody praised so. Compare such a person as that to her George! 
. . . He was only good enough to be a fairy prince; and oh, what 
magnanimity to stoop to such a humble Cinderella! . . ," 8 

(Here again Thackeray does not play quite fair. It is pretty 
clear that the ''goods" of the first sentence are not to be taken 



l66 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

quite at their face-value, but the tone of "silly, romantic ideas" 
is highly ambiguous. Against whom is the irony directed?) 
Certainly after fifteen years of self-deception as widow no one 
can go on taking Amelia as deserving our unqualified sympathy. 
And indeed the whole section dealing with the Sedleys' life 
at Fulham is done with a realism that precludes uncritical 
attitudes. Had Thackeray been by this time wallowing in the 
kind of sentimentality which many readers feel is implicit in 
his attitude to Amelia, he would scarcely have permitted himself 
the realism of allowing young George to leave his mother with 
barely a regret. Nor would he have risked the final description 
of his heroine as a "tender little parasite." 

No, Amelia is no more the heroine of Vanity Fair than 
Becky. She is, rather, the opposite possibility, the image that 
Becky might have chosen to become. And it is Thackeray's 
merit that he shows us Amelia as she is, a parasite, gaining life 
through a submission that is not even an honest submission, 
exploiting her weakness, deceiving even herself. 

The weakness in the pattern of Vanity Fair lies not in 
Amelia (despite the ambiguities I have referred to) but in 
Dobbin. It is he who lets down the novel, not merely because 
he is in the psychological sense unconvincing, but because he 
fails to bear the weight of the positive values implicit in the 
pattern of the book, values which, had they been successfully 
embodied, would have made of this novel a greater Tom Jones, 
a real comic epic in prose. 

Dobbin begins as a sheepish but sensitive schoolboy fighting 
the snobs, but as the novel proceeds he becomes a sort of 
clothes-horse of the respectable middle-class virtues. He is 
shrewd and cultured (young George Osborne finds him a mine 
of information during their trip through Europe) but simple 
and steadfast. How any man of such sense and character could 
remain utterly in love, in quite an adolescent way, with 
Amelia all those years Thackeray can neither explain nor con- 
vince us. Perhaps his is a case of arrested development in the 
emotional sphere ? But no, there is no such suggestion to be 
found. We are to take Dobbin seriously. He is not a hero but he 
is a rock, or rather an oak, the rugged old oak around which 
the tender parasite clings. 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 167 

The effect of Dobbin is to keep, obscurely but nevertheless 
quite definitely, in the background of the novel a wooden sort 
of norm, an average but good man, certainly not a rebel yet 
just as certainly untainted by the values of Vanity Fair. It is 
because he is thus untainted that Dobbin is psychologically 
unconvincing as a character and useless to the pattern of the 
book. For Thackeray's great strength, by and large, is his 
ability to see his characters as parts of a concrete social situation. 
His concern, for instance, with financial details in his novel is 
an example not of a trivial naturalism but of his power of setting 
his people so firmly in the world that we believe in them 
completely even though we know comparatively little about 
them. 

We do not know very much, when all is said, about Becky 
herself. We can only guess how happy she is, what qualms she 
may have, precisely what emotions drive her to act as she does. 
We do not know how much she likes Rawdon and her unkind- 
ness to her child is not quite convincing. She is, as we have 
noticed, always at a distance. And yet she is emphatically there, 
alive beyond a doubt, one of the great characters in all fiction. 
How does Thackeray do it? Fundamentally, I suggest, by this 
precise and firm placing of a character in a concrete social 
situation. We may not be told very much about what Becky 
feels but we know exactly what her situation is. We know her 
relationship, financial and social (in the broadest sense), with 
every other character in the book and we know the guiding 
principle of her conduct, that she wants to be mistress of her 
own life. 

And so the psychological gaps, the gaps in analysis, the 
ambiguities surrounding her do not matter much. Indeed 
there is a sense in which their absence is a positive strength, 
for most such analysis in novels involves unreal abstraction, 
presents problems of character in a static way and diverts 
attention from the reality of the character's actions by an 
exclusive concentration on his motives. In a very important 
sense we know more about Becky than about, say, Proust's 
hero. Like Oliver Twist and Jeanie Deans she has a typical, 
symbolic quality which makes her an individual and yet more 
than an individual. 



l68 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

This sort of typicality is regarded by some critics as a weak- 
ness in art. To say of a character that he is a type is supposed 
to show a deficiency, a failure to individualize on the part of the 
author. But in fact characters in literature who are in no sense 
typical cannot well be artistically interesting. If Hamlet were an 
isolated creature, a being whose individuality made him 
essentially and utterly different from other individuals, a 
neurotic who had lost touch with the typical contours of human 
existence and relationships, he would not be a great artistic 
character. He is in fact no less an individual for being a type, 
a fact which Shakespeare recognized well enough when he 
presented him in the convention of the melancholic man, a 
class of character easily recognizable by and significant to the 
Elizabethan audience. 

The artistic type (and here we see the value of the old 
theory of "humours" despite its psychological crudity) is not 
an average, not a lowest common multiple of human charac- 
teristics, but rather the embodiment of certain forces which 
come together in a particular social situation to create a peculiar 
kind of vital energy. Molifere's miser is not a typical man in the 
sense of being an average man, but he is a type, a more-than- 
individual as well as a very definite, unique individual. Charlie 
Chaplin on the screen is not an average man (no one has ever 
seen anybody quite like him) and yet he is unmistakably typical, 
not just an oddity for all his uniqueness, but somehow more 
typical of the 'little man,' the individual worker in our indust- 
rial society, than any little man we actually know; and in this 
lies his greatness. 

Thackeray's best characters seem to me types in just this 
sense, and it is this quality that gives them their vitality despite 
their distance from the reader, the limits to our knowledge about 
them and the crippling inadequacy of Thackeray's comments. 
Becky is an unmistakable individual, yet she is every woman of 
spirit rebelling against the humiliations forced on her by certain 
social assumptions. Old Osborne, similarly, is every successful 
nineteenth-century business man, encased in a gloomy, 
luxurious ugliness in that big house in Russell Square. How solid 
he is! How all respectable England trembles at the horror of his 
anger when he hears his son has married a bankrupt's daughter! 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 169 

How a whole world and its values comes crowding up as he 
leans over and speaks to his grandson when he hears of old 
John Sedley's death: 

" 'You see/ said old Osborne to George, 'what comes of merit 
and industry, and judicious speculations, and that. Look at me and 
my banker's account. Look at your poor grandfather, Sedley, and 
his failure. And yet he was a better man than I was, this day twenty 
years a better man, I should say, by ten thousand pound.' " 9 

Thackeray himself does his best to destroy his picture of 
the ruling-class world. Only at certain moments will he remove 
himself from the position of chorus and allow the scene to make 
its full effect. Then his talent for the extreme and the bizarre 
is given full scope. Old Osborne reacting to George's death; the 
wicked old Sir Pitt Crawley, helpless, dumb and half-insane, 
sobbing pitifully when left in the charge of a servant-girl; 
Lady Bareacres sitting in her horseless carriage in Brussels; the 
description of Lord Steyne's house and family: such episodes 
are extraordinarily successful. But constantly, throughout the 
whole novel, the effect produced by what the characters do is 
weakened or dissipated by the author's comments. 

It is not so much the sense of these comments as their tone 
that is disastrous. It is an ambiguous tone. In the worst of 
senses it is vulgar. Thackeray's attitude to nearly all his main 
characters and especially Amelia and Becky is ambiguous. 
And the ambiguity does not arise from subtlety, a sense that the 
whole truth can never be told, that there is always a compli- 
cating factor in every judgment; it comes from pusilanimity, 
from a desire to expose illusions and yet keep them. 

The artistic motive-force of Vanity Fair is Thackeray's 
vision of bourgeois society and of the personal relationships 
engendered by that society. That is what his novel is about. 
And the sweep and vividness of it, the vitality of Becky, the 
rich and teeming comic life of the panorama, all derive from 
the insight and honesty of Thackeray's vision. He pierces the 
hypocrisies of Vanity Fair, reveals the disgusting, brutal, 
degrading sordidness behind and below its elegant glitter. 
It is the heyday of bourgeois society that he paints, the days 
when an expanding economy could for a while carry along the 



170 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

hangers-on through the credit it generated (this is how Becky 
and Rawdon manage to live well on nothing a year) despite its 
pitiless rejection of its failures like old John Sedley. And the 
human feeling of Thackeray rebels at this society. And yet 
and yet . . . doesn't he rather like it? To put the doubt in literary 
terms: is Vanity Fair a novel of utter integrity, as Wuthering 
Heights is? 

The human indignation is constantly diluted by the 
clubman's bogus mellowness, not the mellowness of Fielding 
which is based on the real (though limited) security of the 
English revolution, but the mellowness of the successful 
novelist who has looked the world in the face and doesn't care 
to go on looking. He turns to a loose and general cynicism: 

"Ahl Vamtas Vamtatum! Which of us is happy in this world? 
Which of us has his desire? or, having it, is satisfied? Come, 
children, let us shut up the box and the puppets, for our play is 
played out." 10 

It is the feeblest of endings, the flattest of statements of faith. 
And one doesn't even feel that Thackeray means it. 



VII. GEORGE ELIOT: MIDDLEMARCH 

(1871-2) 

T H I s is so large a novel, spacious, unhurried, broad in scope 
and attitude, that to insist that it is the same kind of novel as 
Emma may seem at first a little perverse. The range of interest, 
obviously, is far greater. A concern which includes such issues 
as the relation of art to life, the progress of the biological 
sciences, the social consequences of the Reform Bill of 1832, 
the problems of the scholar's vocation, the psychology of 
martyrdom, such a concern would not appear superficially to 
be usefully comparable with the interests of Jane Austen. Yet 
the range of interest, wonderfully impressive as it is, does not 
reveal any basically new attitude to the art of fiction. George 
Eliot extends the method of Jane Austen but does not 
substantially alter it. 

The world of Middlemarch is bigger and more various than 
that of Highbury, the interests of its inhabitants take different 
forms and lead us to issues which can justly be called wider; 
but Middlemarch^ though it is in some respects the most 
impressive novel in our language and one which it is not 
ridiculous to compare with the novels of Tolstoy, is not in any 
sense a revolutionary work. 

The comparison with Jane Austen is worth developing. In 
the very first chapter of the novel we come upon the description 
of Mr. Brooke: 

"A man nearly sixty, of acquiescent temper, miscellaneous 
opinions, and uncertain vote. He had travelled in his younger years, 
and was held in this part of the country to have contracted a too 
rambling habit of mind. Mr. Brooke's conclusions were as difficult to 
predict as the weather: it was only safe to say that he would act with 
benevolent intentions, and that he would spend as little money as 
possible in carrying them out." 1 

171 



172 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

Apart perhaps from an already apparent interest in her 
characters* 'opinions,' an interest which on this level Jane 
Austen anyway shares, there is nothing whatever to distinguish 
this passage, even in its diction, from similar descriptions in 
Emma. The same quality of wit is there, dependent on a poise 
which in its turn depends on a precise and highly conscious set 
of social values which emanate from full participation in the 
life of a particular community. The next sentence, however, 
marks a change: 

"For the most glutinously indefinite minds enclose some hard 
grains of habit; and a man has been seen lax about all his own 
interests except the retention of his snuff-box, concerning which he 
was watchful, suspicious, and greedy of clutch." 

It is not merely that with the introduction of the word 
glutinously we sense a lack of "elegance" which in Emma 
would never do; the whole sentence has a heaviness, almost a 
clumsiness, which corresponds to a habit of mind in George 
Eliot quite distinct from that of the earlier novelist. A certain 
forcing of the issue, one might call it, a tendency to illustrate a 
shade too often the moral generalization. From a description, 
witty and certainly not morally uncritical, of Mr. Brooke, a 
description in which his vitality as a character and our view of 
him are developed together, we pass immediately to the 
generalization which has the effect of putting Mr. Brooke away 
at a distance again. Almost imperceptibly, with the "has been 
seen," we have passed from Mr. Brooke's "mind" (such as it is) 
to "minds" in general The transition is not offensive and it 
marks one of the great strengths of George Eliot as a novelist, 
her insistence that we should continuously relate her fiction 
to our lives, that we should not lose ourselves in the fantastic 
world of the novel; but it illustrates the direction of the 
modification she brings to Jane Austen's method. When Jane 
Austen in Emma offers us a generalized comment, such as her 
remarks about dancing and the holding of dances, we feel no 
temptation to apply her irony as a thought on the meaning of 
Life; with George Eliot the more presumptuous claim implicit 
in the capital letter is for ever being made. 

That the claim is not fatuous is ensured by the breadth of 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 173 

her interest and the inclusiveness of her prodigious intelligence. 
Let us turn to another of her minor characters, Mrs. 
Cadwallader: 

"Her life was rurally simple, quite free from secrets either foul, 
dangerous, or otherwise important, and not consciously affected by 
the great affairs of the world. All the more did the affairs of the great 
world interest her when communicated in the letters of high-born 
relations: the way in which fascinating younger sons had gone to the 
dogs by marrying their mistresses, the fine old-blooded idiocy of 
young Lord Tapir, and the furious gouty humours of old Lord 
Megatherium; the exact crossing of genealogies which had brought 
a coronet into a new branch and widened the relations of scandal, 
these were topics of which she retained details with the utmost 
accuracy, and reproduced them in an excellent pickle of epigrams, 
which she herself enjoyed the more because she believed as unques- 
tioningly in birth and no-birth as she did in game and vermin. She 
would never have disowned any one on the ground of poverty: a 
De Bracy reduced to take his dinner in a basin would have seemed 
to her an example of pathos worth exaggerating, and I fear his 
aristocratic vices would not have horrified her. But her feeling 
towards the vulgar rich was a sort of religious hatred; they had pro- 
bably made all their money out of high retail prices, and Mrs. 
Cadwallader detested high prices for everything that was not paid 
in kind at the Rectory: such people were no part of God's design 
in making the world; and their accent was an affliction to the ears. 
A town where such monsters abounded was hardly more than a sort 
of low comedy, which could not be taken account of in a well-bred 
scheme of the universe. Let any lady who is inclined to be hard on 
Mrs. Cadwallader inquire into the comprehensiveness of her own 
beautiful views, and be quite sure that they afford accommodation 
for all the lives which have the honour to coexist with hers. 

With such a mind, active as phosphorous, biting everything that 
came near into the form that suited it, how could Mrs. Cadwallader 
feel that the Miss Brookes and their matrimonial prospects were 
alien to her?" 2 

George Eliot is sometimes regarded as a worthy but 
essentially forbidding writer; her Puritanism is too easily 
associated with a moral narrowness. It is a very unfair criticism. 
The vivacity of the passage just quoted has nothing narrow 
about it. The^wit is 'deeper' than Jane Austen's wit only in the 
sense that a more variously stocked consciousness is involved. 



174 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

"Rurally simple" places the parish of Tipton in a world larger 
than anyone in Emma contemplates. The play on "the great 
affairs of the world" and "the affairs of the great world" 
involves a knowledge of "affairs" to which Jane Austen would 
make no claim and it is not a bogus knowledge. On the 
contrary George Eliot's urbanity is quite without the shallow- 
ness of a superficial sophistication and it gives a wonderful 
breadth and solidity to her criticism. "Fine old-blooded 
idiocy": the phrase might easily be shrill, the criticism 
crude, but in fact it adequately encompasses a whole stratum 
of society. Mrs. Cadwallader's "excellent pickle of epigrams" 
is backed by her creator's own wit, just as the force of "active 
as phosphorous" is backed by George Eliot's awareness of 
scientific processes. The point is not, of course, that George 
Eliot is more intelligent than Jane Austen but that her intelli- 
gence has encompassed a larger field. 

In the passage on Mrs. Cadwallader, as in that on Mr. 
Brooke, a tell-tale sentence intrudes. "Let any lady who is 
inclined to be hard on Mrs. Cadwallader inquire into the 
comprehensiveness of her own beautiful views, and be quite 
sure that they afford accommodation for all the lives which have 
the honour to coexist with hers." Again we have the direct 
thrust at the reader's conscience, not offensive in itself, yet 
less than fully incorporated in George Eliot's overall purposes. 
The adjective "beautiful" is clumsy and inadequate, the irony 
implicit in it crude, not on the level of the use of previous 
adjectives. And the phrase "all the lives which have the 
honour, etc." is an uncertain one. In what sense is "honour" 
to be read? Against what is the irony directed? The ambiguity 
betrays a weakness. Why is the sentence there at all? 

Can we, perhaps, in these sentences in which George Eliot 
turns her moral gaze direct upon the reader and beckons to his 
personal conscience, isolate a weakness in her method and put 
our finger on a note in Middlemarch which may justly be 
described as a shade flat? It is a complicated question to which 
we shall have to return. 

Meanwhile let us turn to another description in Middle- 
march, that scene when Dorothea, six weeks after her marriage, 
is disclosed weeping in her apartment in Rome. 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 175 

"To those who have looked at Rome with the quickening power 
of a knowledge which breathes a growing soul into all historic shapes, 
and traces out the suppressed transitions which unite all contrasts, 
Rome may still be the spiritual centre and interpreter of the world. 
But let them conceive one more historical contrast: the gigantic 
broken revelations of that Imperial and Papal city thrust abruptly 
on the notions of a girl who had been brought up in English and 
Swiss Puritanism, fed on meagre Protestant histories and an art 
chiefly of the hand-screen sort; a girl whose ardent nature turned all 
her small allowance of knowledge into principles, fusing her actions 
into their mould, and whose quick emotions gave the most abstract 
things the quality of pleasure or pain, a girl who had lately become a 
wife, and from the enthusiastic acceptance of untried duty found 
herself plunged in tumultuous preoccupation with her personal lot. 
The weight of unintelligible Rome might lie easily on bright nymphs 
to whom it formed a background for the brilliant picnic of Anglo- 
Foreign society: but Dorothea had no such defence against deep 
impressions. Ruins and basilicas, palaces and collossi, set in the 
midst of a sordid present, where all that was living and warm- 
blooded seemed sunk in the deep degeneracy of a superstition 
divorced from reverence; the dimmer but yet eager Titanic life 
gazing and struggling on walls and ceilings; the long vistas of white 
forms whose marble eyes seemed to hold tne monotonous light of an 
alien world: all this vast wreck of ambitious ideals, sensuous and 
spiritual, mixed confusedly with the signs of breathing forgetfulness 
and degradation, at first jarred her as with an electric shock, and 
then urged themselves on her with that ache belonging to a glut of 
confused ideas which check the flow of emotion. Forms both pale 
and glowing took possession of her young sense, and fixed them- 
selves in her memory even when she was not thinking of them, 
preparing strange associations which remained through her after- 
years. Our moods are apt to bring with them images which succeed 
each other like the magic-lantern pictures of a doze; and in certain 
states of dull forlornness Dorothea all her life continued to see the 
vastness of St. Peter's, the huge bronze canopy, the excited intention 
in the attitudes and garments of the prophets and evangelists in the 
mosaics above, and the red drapery which was being hung for Christ- 
mas spreading itself everywhere like a disease of the retina. 

Not that this inward amazement of Dorothea's was anything 
very exceptional: many souls in their young nudity are tumbled out 
among incongruities and left to 'find their feet' among them, while 
their elders go about their business. Not can I suppose that when 



176 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

Mrs. Casaubon is discovered in a fit of weeping six weeks after her 
wedding, the situation will be regarded as tragic. Some discourage- 
ment, some faintness of heart at the new real future which replaces 
the imaginary, is not unusual and we do not expect people to be 
deeply moved by what is not unusual. That element of tragedy which 
lies in the very fact of frequency, has not yet wrought itself into the 
coarse emotion of mankind; and perhaps our frames could hardly 
bear much of it. If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary 
human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the 
squirrel's heart beat, and we should die of that roar which lies on 
the other side of silence. As it is, the quickest of us walk about well 
wadded with stupidity." 3 

It is a passage which shows George Eliot, if not quite at 
her best, as the great novelist she is; and it shows very clearly 
the direction of her extension of Jane Austen's method. It 
is, for a piece of writing describing and analysing a peculiarly 
intimate personal emotion, a remarkably impersonal passage. 
Dorothea's own feelings, though we are persuasively made to 
understand them, are revealed as embedded within a 
generalized situation. George Eliot begins by recalling the 
Roman scene, not through anyone's sense-impressions, but in 
its historical, highly intellectualized context. The clash of 
Catholic and Protestant, pagan and Puritan, are evoked at 
first objectively and then made gradually to illuminate 
Dorothea's mental state. 

Only very occasionally are we brought into contact with her 
actual feelings. We do not feel closer to her as we read on, but 
we understand her better and the understanding is not a purely 
objective one. George Eliot has here herself the power to give 
"the most abstract things the quality of a pleasure or a pain" 
because under her contemplation of the particular, concrete 
situation (Dorothea's state of mind at this moment) the 
generalized experience and abstract thought cease to be 
abstract and become symbolic the squirrel's heart-beat and 
the roar which lies on the other side of silence. 

The achievement of the symbolic moment, the instant in 
which through our gained insight into the particular situation 
a new apprehension of the processes of life is reached, is not 
frequent in Middlemarch. By and large the novel is no more 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 177 

symbolic than Emma. It works on our consciousness through 
the presentation of very real, rounded characters in a very real, 
solidly-constructed social situation. 

George Eliot takes a great deal of pains with her 'back- 
ground' and the question arises as to whether background is 
the right word to use. What, we have to ask ourselves, is the 
central theme, the unifying subject of this Study of Provincial 
Life? 

From the Prelude one gathers that this is to be a novel 
about latter-day Saint Theresas, about those whose flames, "fed 
from within, soared after some illimitable satisfaction, some 
object which would never justify weariness, which would 
reconcile self-despair with the rapturous consciousness of life 
beyond self "; and we are given the hint that the problem of such 
modern saints is that they are "helped by no coherent social 
faith and order which could perform the function of knowledge 
for the ardently willing soul." 4 

This expectation is immediately justified by the introduc- 
tion of Dorothea Brooke, the mention of the Blessed Virgin in 
the second sentence of the first chapter confirming all our 
anticipation. And the first movement of the novel, the whole of 
the first book up to the introduction of Lydgate, continues the 
development of the theme. Dorothea is the centre of it and 
Dorothea is presented to us wonderfully, her limitations, her 
immaturity, her "theoretic" mind no less than her ardour, 
her yearning for a life more deeply satisfying than Tipton and 
Middlemarch can give. 

Up to this point Middlemarch may be said to be to the 
novel what Highbury is to Emma> the world in which Dorothea 
and Casaubon and the surrounding characters live, and very 
subtly does George Eliot convey how Middlemarch has made 
them what they are. We feel no temptation to abstract these 
characters from the society that contains them. Dorothea is not 
Saint Theresa. She is an intelligent and sensitive girl born into 
the English landed ruling class of the early nineteenth century, 
full of half-formulated dissatisfactions with the fatuous, genteel 
life of the women of her class, seeking something beyond the 
narrow 'selfishness' of her acquaintances and turning towards a 
religious Puritanism and a high-minded philanthropy (cottages 



178 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

for the farm-labourers) to satisfy her unfulfilled potentialities; 
finally and disastrously imagining that in marriage to Casaubon 
she will find the fulfilment of her aspirations. 

It is with the introduction of Lydgate, quickly followed by 
the Vincys and Bulstrode, that the basic structure of the novel 
changes. We know now that George Eliot in fact joined together 
in Middlemarch two novels originally planned separately the 
story of Miss Brooke and the story of Lydgate. But even without 
this knowledge we should find, before the end of the first book, 
a change coming over Middlemarch. George Eliot forces the 
problem on our attention in Chapter XI, just after the 
introduction of Lydgate and Rosamond. 

"Certainly nothing at present could seem much less important 
to Lydgate than the turn of Miss Brooke's mind, or to Miss Brooke 
than the qualities of the woman who had attracted this young 
surgeon. But any one watching keenly the stealthy convergence of 
human lots, sees a slow preparation of effects from one life on 
another, which tells like a calculated irony on the indifference or the 
frozen stare with which we look at our unintroduced neighbour. 
Destiny stands by sarcastic with our dramatis persona folded in her 
hand. 

Old provincial society had its share of this kind of subtle move- 
ment: had not only its striking downfalls, its brilliant young pro- 
fessional dandies who ended by living up an entry with a drab and 
six children for their establishment, but also those less marked 
vicissitudes which are constantly shifting the boundaries of social 
intercourse and begetting new consciousness of inter-dependence. 
Some slipped a little downward some got higher footing: people 
denied aspirates, gained wealth, and fastidious gentlemen stood for 
boroughs; some were caught in political currents, some in ecclesiasti- 
cal, and perhaps found themselves surprisingly grouped in conse- 
quence; while a few personages or families that stood with rocky 
firmness amid all this fluctuation, were slowly presenting new 
aspects in spite of solidity, and altering with the double change of 
self and beholder. Municipal town and rural parish gradually made 
fresh threads of connection gradually, as the old stocking gave way 
to the savings bank, and the worship of the solar guinea became 
extinct; while squires and baronets, and even lords who had once 
lived blamelessly afar from the civic mind, gathered the faultiness of 
closer acquaintanceship. Settlers, too, came from distant counties, 
some with an alarming novelty of skill, others with an offensive 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 179 

advantage in cunning. In fact, much the same sort of movement 
and mixture went on in old England as we find in older Herodotus, 
who also, in telling what had been, thought it well to take a woman's 
lot for his starting point." 5 

It is a clumsy passage and its clumsiness comes from its 
function as a bridge between what the novel started as and what 
it is becoming; but it is also a passage full of interest to an 
analysis of the book. "Destiny stands by sarcastic with our 
dramatis persona folded in her hand": It is a pretentious, 
unhelpful sentence, calling up a significance it does not satisfy. 
Who, one feels tempted to ask, is this Destiny, a character 
previously unmentioned by the author? And, as a matter of fact, 
the figure of a sarcastic fate does not preside over Middlemarch. 
On the contrary George Eliot is at pains to dissociate herself 
from any such concept. Throughout the novel with an 
almost remorseless insistence, each moral crisis, each necessary 
decision is presented to the participants and to us with the 
minimum of suggestion of an all-powerful Destiny. It is the 
very core of George Eliot's morality and of the peculiar moral 
force of the book that her characters, despite most powerful 
pressures, and above all the prevailing pressure of the Middle- 
march way of life, are not impelled to meet each particular 
choice in the way they do. Lydgate need not have married 
Rosamond, though we understand well enough why he did. 
Neither need Fred Vincy have reformed; it is George Eliot's par- 
ticular achievement here that she convinces us of a transforma- 
tion against which all the cards of 'Destiny' have been stacked. 

My point here is that the appearance of this concept in 
Chapter XI is not justified by the total organization of the book 
and that it betrays a weakness, a lack of control, which is 
intimately connected with the transformation of the novel from 
the story of Dorothea to something else. 

The something else is indicated in the sentence beginning 
"Old provincial society . . ." We realize as we read on that the 
centre of attention of the novel is indeed being shifted, so that 
the story of Miss Brooke is now not an end in itself but a 
starting-point. What we are to contemplate is nothing less 
than the whole subtle movement of old provincial society. The 
background has become the subject. 



l8o AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

That it was bound to do so has already been hinted. So 
firmly is the story of Dorothea in those early chapters 'set' in 
the society of which she is a part, that it seems almost inevitable 
that an adequate examination of Dorothea must involve an 
examination of the Middlemarch world more thorough than 
that so far contemplated, and there is no doubt that it was under 
a sense of this compulsion that George Eliot altered the plan of 
the book and called it Middlemarch. And the central question 
in our estimate of the novel is how far she succeeds in this 
great, ambitious attempt thus to capture and reveal the relation 
of each individual story, the stories of Dorothea, of Lydgate, 
of Bulstrode, to the whole picture, the Middlemarch world. 

Dr. Leavis, in his extremely interesting section on George 
Eliot in The Great Tradition, writes: "George Eliot had 
said in Felix Holt, by way of apology for the space she devoted 
to 'social changes' and 'public matters': 'there is no private life 
which has not been determined by a wider public life/ The aim 
implicit in this remark is magnificently achieved in Middlemarch, 
and it is achieved by a novelist whose genius manifests itself 
in a profound analysis of the individual." 6 With the last 
statement the emphasis on the profound analysis one must 
assuredly agree and one could not hope valuably to add to 
Dr. Leavis's remarks on Casaubon, Lydgate, Rosamond and 
Bulstrode; nor is one disposed to quarrel with his estimate of 
the treatment of Ladislaw and Dorothea. 

Middlemarch is a wonderfully rich and intelligent book and 
its richness lies in a consideration of individual characters firmly 
placed in an actual social situation (it is because Ladislaw is 
never thus placed but remains a romantic dream-figure that 
he is a failure). But there seems to me a contradiction at the 
heart of Middlemarch^ a contradiction between the success of 
the parts and the relative failure of the whole. 

Middlemarch as a whole is not a deeply moving book. The 
total effect is immensely impressive but not immensely 
compelling. Our consciousness is modified and enriched but 
not much changed. We are moved by particular things in the 
book: by the revelation of Casaubon's incapacity; by the hideous 
quality of the Lydgate-Rosamond impasse (certainly upon our 
pulses this), he unable to find a chink in her smooth blonde 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY l8l 

armour and she incapable of understanding the kind of man he 
could have been; by Dorothea's disillusionment in Rome; by 
the scene in which Mrs. Bulstrode accepts her share in her 
husband's downfall. Mrs. Bulstrode, conventional, unprofound, 
more than a little smug, a pillar of the church and the Middle- 
march bourgeoisie, learns of the black disgrace of her husband 
through the revelation of his totally discreditable past: 

" *But you must bear up as well as you can, Harriet. People 
don't blame you. And I'll stand by you whatever you make up your 
mind to do,' said the brother, with rough but well-meaning 
affectionateness . 

'Give me your arm to the carriage, Walter,' said Mrs. Bulstrode, 
'I feel very weak/ 

And when she got home she was obliged to say to her daughter. 
"I am not well my dear; I must go and lie down. Attend to your 
papa. Leave me in quiet. I shall take no dinner.' 

She locked herself in her room. She needed time to get used to 
her maimed consciousness, her poor lopped life, before she could 
walk steadily to the place allotted her. A new searching light had 
fallen on her husband's character, and she could not judge him 
leniently: the twenty years in which she had believed in him and 
venerated him by virtue of his concealments came back with par- 
ticulars that made them seem an odious deceit. He had married her 
with that bad past life hidden behind hi m and she had no faith left 
to protest his innocence of the worst that was imputed to him. Her 
honest ostentatious nature made the sharing of a merited dishonour 
as bitter as it could be to any mortal. 

But this imperfectly-taught woman, whose phrases and habits 
were an odd patch-work, had a loyal spirit within her. The man 
whose prosperity she had shared through nearly half a life, and who 
had unvarying cherished her now that punishment had befallen 
him it was not possible to her in any sense to forsake him. There is 
a forsaking which still sits at the same board and lies on the same 
couch with the forsaken soul, withering it the more by unloving 
proximity. She knew, when she locked her door, that she should 
unlock it ready to go down to her unhappy husband and espouse his 
sorrow, and say of his guilt, I will mourn and not reproach. But she 
needed time to gather up her strength; she needed to sob out her 
farewell to all the gladness and pride of her life. When she had 
resolved to go down, she prepared herself by some little acts which 
might seem mere folly to a hard onlooker; they were her way of 



182 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

expressing to all spectators visible or invisible that she had begun a 
new life in which she embraced humiliation. She took off all her 
ornaments and put on a plain black gown, and instead of wearing 
her much-adorned cap and large bows of hair, she brushed her hair 
down and out on a plain bonnet-cap, which made her look suddenly 
like an early Methodist. 

Bulstrode, who knew that his wife had been out and had come in 
saying that she was not well, had spent the time in an agitation equal 
to hers. He had looked forward to her learning the truth from others, 
and had acquiesced in that probability, as something easier to him 
than any confession. But now that he imagined the moment of her 
knowledge come, he awaited the result in anguish. His daughters had 
been obliged to consent to leave him, and though he had allowed 
some food to be brought to him, he had not touched it. He felt 
himself perishing slowly in unpitied misery. Perhaps he should never 
see his wife's face with affection in it again. And if he turned to God 
there seemed to be no answer but the pressure of retribution. 

It was eight o'clock in the evening before the door opened and 
his wife entered. He dared not look up at her. He sat with his eyes 
bent down, and as she went towards him she thought he looked 
smaller he seemed so withered and shrunken. A movement of new 
compassion and old tenderness went through her like a great wave, 
and putting one hand on his which rested on the arm of the chair, 
and the other on his shoulder, she said, solemnly but kindly 

'Lookup, Nicholas.' 

He raised his eyes with a little start and looked at her half amazed 
for a moment: her pale face, her changed mourning dress, the tremb- 
ling about her mouth, all said 'I know': and her hands and eyes 
rested gently on him. He burst out crying and they cried together, 
she sitting at his side. They could not yet speak to each other of the 
shame which she was bearing with him, or of the facts which had 
brought it down on them. His confession was silent, and her promise 
of faithfulness was silent. Open-minded as she was, she nevertheless 
shrank from the words which would have expressed their mutual 
consciousness as she would have shrunk from flakes of fire. She could 
not say, 'How much is only slander and false suspicion? ' and he did 
not say, 'I am innocent/ " 7 

In such an episode as this the moral and emotional basis of a 
personal relationship is explored with an insight and a sympathy 
wholly admirable. And we are moved not simply because 
George Eliot's moral concern is so profound and sure but 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 183 

because the scene, with its many ramifications (including the 
implicit comparison with the attitude of Rosamond), is presen- 
ted with so deep a sense of the social interpenetration that 
makes up life. And yet it is the paradox of the novel this 
sense of social interpenetration, so remarkably revealed in the 
exploration of the individual dilemma and so consistently and 
consciously sought after by George Eliot throughout the novel, 
does not in fact infuse the book as a whole. 

Middkmarch taken in its completeness has almost every- 
thing except what is ultimately the most important thing of all, 
that final vibrant intensity of the living organism. Despite its 
superb achievements, despite the formidable intelligence which 
controls the whole book and rewards us, each time we return 
to it, with new insights, new richness of analysis and observa- 
tion, there is something missing. We do not care about these 
people in the way in which, given the sum of human life and 
wisdom involved, we ought to care. What is lacking is not 
understanding, not sympathy, not warmth, certainly not 
seriousness. 

George Eliot is the most intelligent of novelists; she always 
knows what she ought to do and she never shirks any issue. 
But she seems to lack what one might call a sense of the vital 
motion of things: she feels after this sense, but does not capture 
it. For all her intellect, all her human sympathy, all her nobility 
and generosity of mind, there is something of life that eludes 
her, that sense of the contradictions within every action and 
situation which is the motive-force of artistic energy and which 
perhaps Keats was seeking to express when he referred to 
Shakespeare's "negative capability." 

George Eliot possesses this negative capability when she 
explores a particular situation, a concrete problem; then the 
conflicts within the essence are perforce accepted and in 
fighting themselves out breathe the breath of life into the scene. 
But it is as though in her philosophy, her consciously formulated 
outlook, there is no place for the inner contradiction. The word 
"determined" in the sentence from Felix Holt quoted by Dr, 
Leavis is, I think, significant. 

I believe that most of the weaknesses of Middkmarch 
spring from this. It is behind the failure to impose an organic 



184 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH NOVEL 

unity on the novel. The intention is, clearly, that Middlemarch 
itself should be the unifying factor, but in fact it is not. The 
'subtle movement* of society which George Eliot herself refers 
to is not, in the achieved novel, caught. On the contrary the 
view of society presented is a static one. Nor is this simply 
because provincial society in the Midlands about 1832 was 
indeed comparatively unchanging (no society is really static 
when an artist looks at it), though it is perhaps significant that 
George Eliot, writing in the 18708, should have set her novel 
forty years back. What is more important is the failure of the 
attempts to give 'historical colour' (like the surveying of the 
railroad and the election scenes) which are conscientious but 
not on the artistic level convincing, not integral to the 
novel's pattern. 

More vital still is the fact that the various stories within the 
novel, though linked by the loose plot, have no organic unity. 
Many of the chief characters are related by blood, but their 
artistic relationship within the pattern of the novel is not fully 
realized. Between the story of Dorothea and that of Lydgate 
there is, it is true, an essential link. Lydgate's career (it is not 
by accident that he is a man) is the other side of the Saint 
Theresa theme. "Lydgate and Dorothea together are the 
vehicle for the main theme in Middlemarch. The compromise 
each ultimately makes between the life to which they aspired 
and the life the conditions permit symbolises the conception at 
the heart of the book!" 8 Mrs. Bennett's remark is to the point; 
and the phrase "the life the conditions permit" is, I think, 
most significant. 

For in such a phrase the limitation of the view of society 
implicit in Middlemarch is revealed and the reason for George 
Eliot's ultimate failure to capture its movement indicated. 
Society in this novel is presented to us as 'there'; that it is a part 
of a historical process is suggested intellectually only. And 
because the Middlemarch world is the given, static reality, the 
characters of the novel must be seen as at its mercy. They are 
free to make certain moral decisions within the bounds of the 
Middlemarch world, yet they are held captive by that world. 

Hence the temptation of George Eliot, once she accepts the 
social implications of her story, to introduce an unconvincing, 



THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 185 

unrealized 'Destiny.' The artist in her does not believe in this 
Destiny and therefore when her imagination is fully engaged in 
the exploration of a concrete problem of individual relationships 
the concept of an impregnable social destiny disappears. But it 
is always lurking in the background and it eats into the overall 
vitality of the novel. In a sense it is a product of George Eliot's 
strength, her recognition of the complex social basis of morality. 
Had she not felt compelled to make Middlemarch the chief 
character of her book (a compulsion springing from her own 
honesty of analysis) she would not have needed the further 
social understanding which her later conception of the novel 
involved. She would not have attempted that advance on the 
art of Jane Austen which makes her at once a more impressive 
novelist and a less satisfactory one. 

George Eliot's view of society is in the last analysis a 
mechanistic and determinist one. She has an absorbing sense 
of the power of society but very little sense of the way it changes. 
Hence her moral attitudes, like her social vision, tend to be 
static. "We are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the 
world as an udder to feed our supreme selves." 9 The image, 
more than half ironical as it seems to be in the particular 
context, is significant, hinting as it does at a fully mechanistic 
outlook (not unlike Locke's conception of the mind as a blank 
sheet of white paper) in which the individual is essentially 
passive, a recipient of impressions, changed by the outside 
world but scarcely able to change it. 

It is not by chance that human aspirations fare poorly in 
Middlemarch. All of the main characters, save Dorothea and 
Ladislaw and Mary and Fred, are defeated by Middlemarch 
and Mary and Fred are undefeated only because they have 
never fought a thorough-going battle with the values of 
Middlemarch society. Mary and the Garths, it is true, reject 
the more distasteful aspects of nineteenth-century morality
